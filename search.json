They don’t need their structure to be defined in advance and can change over time. Genomic data is well suited to the document structure because files like VCFs have extensible fields and can vary. These databases also have faster write operations and in-memory indexes that improve query efficiency. Some relational database management systems have the ability to work with both relational and semi-structured data.\nThis paper assesses the efficiency of different database types (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)to store and query SNP annotations from dbSNP.

JSONB objects with PostgreSQL had faster write performance followed by MongoDB and PostgreSQL.\n\n\nIndex Creation\nThe time needed to create an index on the dbSNP data depended on the field used to create it on. For the JSONB PostgreSQL implementation, the Generalized Inverted Index method provided the best indexing results on the clinical significance or the gene name. Since the GIN cannot make a unique index, when the RSID field was indexed, it was significantly slower than the other databases.\n\n\nQuery performance\nMongoDB performed best on all but complex queries while MySQL has the lowest. For the complex query, PostgreSQL with JSONB was the fastest. Overall the document based models were significantly faster than the relational ones."

    "text": "DNA methylation mechanism\nWhile genetic mechanisms of oncogenesis are more easily seen and understood, epigenetic mechanisms can be powerful ones that can be transferred through cell divisions. Mutations in epigenetic regulators are important lead to major changes in cancer cell epigenomes. Genetic mechanisms can inactivate tumor-supressor genes or work with epigenetic mechanisms to make mutations and epigenetic dsyregulation more likely.\n\nCpG cytosine-5 methylation\nThis is catalysed by DNMT3A and DNMT3B and maintained by DNAMT3B. Most of the mammalian genome is not methylated. The sparse methylated regions contain heavily methylated CpG dinucleotides and unmethylated CpG islands that are protected from DNA methylation by guanine-cytosine strand asymmetry and R loop formation. There may also be active demethylation by TET proteins. CpG islands are present on the start sites of half of human genes - genes that are actively expressed or about to be.\nMethyl-CpG binding domains (MBD) or C2H2 zinc fingers recognize methylation DNA. MBDs and Kaiso (zinc finger) are involved in DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes with promoter DNA methylation.\n\n\nHistone variants and modifications\nHistone modifications are carried out by histone methyltransferases demethylases, acetyltransferases and deacetylases, and writers and erasers of phosphorylation and other modifications. They act in complexes like the Polycomb complec and counterbalance each other to regulate developmental genes, some of which are implicated in cancer. The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) allows PRC1 to dock. PRC1 has a RING1B enzymatic core that monoubiquitinylates histone H2A at K119 and blocks RNA polymerase II elongation. The H3K4 methylation mark made by the Trithorax group complex counters Polycomb function. PRC2 targets embryonic stem cell transcription factors for differentiation and development regulators with the activating H3K4me3 and the repressive H3K27me3 marks. The Trithorax demethylase KDM6A can remove this repressive mark allowing for gene transcription for differentiation. Genes not needed for this process lose the activating mark and gain the repressive one.\nHistone variants are found in different cell types and regions. Some like H2A.Z are found in regions requiring frequent changes and wide prevalence indicates prevalent chromatin exchange in embryonic stem cells.\n\n\nNucleosome positioning and remodelling\nNucleosome position can influence transcriptional activation and repression. There are chromatin remodelling complexes (SWI/SNF, chromodomain and helicase-like domain(CHD), ISWI and INO80) that can change nucleosome positions\nOther epigenetic changes include:\n\nHydroxylation\nFormylation\nCarboxylation\n\nThese changes are made by\n\ninitiators like lncRNAs,\nwriters establish marks, guided by sequence context, existing marks and bound proteins, ncRNAs, or nuclear architecture. Mutations to writers like DNMT3A are often found in cancers and\n\nreaders that interpret them,\nerasers like TET that remove them,\nremodelers that reposition nucleosomes and\nInsulators\nInsulators form boundaries between epigenetic domains and include the CCCTC-binding factor CTCF and CTCFL/BORIS. CTCF prevents enhancer interactions with unintended promoters. It also separates active and repressive chromatin domains.\n\n\n\nEpigenetic state maintainance\nThe epigenome is copied between cell divisions by DNMT1 and H3K9 methyltransferase which are loaded into the replication fork and copy the marks. The Trithorax and Polycomb complexes are recruited during replication and distributed between the daughter cells to restore marks."

    "section": "Epigenetic disruption in cancer",
    "text": "Epigenetic disruption in cancer\nStudies have found contradictory changes in DNA methylation in cancer. Some find hypomethylation while others find hypermethylation of CpG islands. We know epigenetic changes can be causal in cancer since many tumor-supressor genes have been silenced by promoter CpG islands hypermethylation independent of mutational or structural inactivation of the gene. Further mouse models need epigenetic readers and writers for tumor development. Some methylation changes are essential for cancer cell survival.\n\nDisruption of differentiation and development\nPolycomb repressors mark genes differentiation and development regulator genes depending on that cells trajectory. These genes tend to be hypermethylated in their CpG islands during proliferation, ageing and malignant transformation. Cancer cells also show silencing of differentiation genes. This suggests a model where Polycomb target genes in stem cells acquire permanent silencing over time and lose their ability to differentiate, but are still able to proliferate. This would mean that it is an epigenetic modification rather than a genetic one that leads to malignant transformation.\n\n\nCpG island methylator phenotypes\nThe CpG island methylator phenotype shows a high frequency of CpG island hypermethylation. There are distinct epigenetic subtypes for some cancers like CRC and glioblastoma, while others like ovarian cancer do not show such distinct subtypes.\n\n\nEpigenetic influences on genomic integrity\nEpigenetic mechanisms can affect the rates of lesion formation and repair. Methylated and unmethylated cytosine can both be deaminated. Unmethylated C forms uracil and 5mC forms thymine. Since uracil is not part of normal DNA is it more likely to be found and repaired than a change to thymine which leads to a 10-fold higher rate of C-to-T mutations in CpG dinucleotides that mostly contain MeC than other SNVs in the genome. The deamination of 5mC before replication leads to a normal T:A base that is not a repair candidate. About a quarter of TP53 mutations in cancer result from this epigenetic mark.\n\n\nRegional effects of chromatic organization\nMegabase regions of repressive chromatin (H3K9me3) are correlated with cancer SNVs. Genes resistant to cancer-associated hypermethylation tend to have retrotransposons near their transcription start sites compared to methylation-prone genes. Mouse models of DNMT deficiency tend to have chromosomal instability.\n\n\nEpigenetic influences on DNA repair\nRemoval of DNA methyltransferases can lead to increased microsatellite instability (MSI), increased telomere lengths and telomeric recombination. The epigenetic silencing of DNA repair genes like MLH1 can lead to an increase in mutation rates and genomic instability in cancer cells.\nMutations of epigenetic regulator genes like writers and erasers can be mechanisms of oncogenesis. DNMT3A and TET2 mutations have been found in cancers.\nHistone gene mutations can also be involved in cancer as they affect histone positioning and telomeres. Some like the K27M mutation mimic a Polycomb repressive mark. Histone methylation writer mutations like in MLL are found in leukemias. This may work by the inappropriate recruitment of epigenetic factors to MLL targets. Some writers like EZH2 have both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in cancer. This may be part of a control system with different functions in different environments that are dysregulated when mutations occur in these genes.\nChromatin remodelling involves remodelling the structure and positioning of nucleosomes to enable access. Chromatin remodeler mutations are implicated in a number of different cancers. SWI/SNF complexes are remodelers with mutations in rhabdoid tumors."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology\nAug 9, 2019\nDNA methylation of the 5mC is associated with transcriptional repression and through that repression affects genomic imprinting X chromosome inactivation, repressing transposons and germline-specific genes. The methylation enables a higher mutation rate as 5mC is deaminated to a thymine, which when paired with A, is not easily repaired. Most cancer types show a dysregulation of DNA methylation.\nThe mammalian genome undergoes major epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization and germline cell specification.\n\nCellular functions of DNA methylation\nDNMT3A and DNMT3B are the two major de novo DNA methylation enzymes. They have a highly conserved methyltransferase domain and two chromatin reading domains.\nThe bodies of actively transcribed genes are enriched with DNA methylation, while active promoters are unmethylated. De novo methylation can occur in any sequence context, but only the methylation in CpG contexts are preserved through cell division by the methylation maintenance enzyme DNMT1 working with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1.\nDemethylation is done by TET that oxidises methylation cytosine. Oxidised forms of C can promote demethylation during replication.\nGene bodies tend to be quite heavily methylated which is paradoxical since methylation makes mutagenesis more likely. It may be because it facilitates transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing. It may also repress intragenic cryptic promoters.\n\nCpG-island promoter methylation\nMost of mammalian promoters are CpG-islands that are rarely methylated. They are methylated in the cases on X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and in germline specific genes.\nGenomic imprinting is when genes expression is controlled based on whether the gene was inherited from the father or mother. Germline-specific genes need to be repressed with the onset of somatic differentiation during implantation.\n\n\nRetrotransposons\nThe main targets of DNA methylation are retrotransposons that occupy around half of the genomic space. Their expression is controlled by CpG-rich promoters whose methylation is necessary for silencing them. DNMT3C is a newly discovered de novo DNMT specifically working to control retrotransposons. DNA methylation also servers to inactivate retrotransposons through the increased mutagenesis by deamination.\n\n\n\nMethylation patterning in development\nReprogramming occurs first after fertilization where the embryo loses gamete-specific DNA methylation patterns. Then there is a gradual loss of methylation until the blastocyst stage. However, there remains substantial methylation after the global demethylation processes which could possibly imply the existence of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.\nSex-specific patterns of methylation are established in germlines. Sperm have 80% CpG methylation while oocytes have 50% methylation.\n\n\nMethylation and disease\nDNMT1 mutations is associated with neurological disorders like hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy 1E with dementia and hearing loss. DNMT3B mutations are found in immunodeficiency diseases. Heterozygous, germline mutations in DNMT3A are associated with growth disorders of early prenatal onset. Somatic mutations of this gene are linked to adult cancers like acute myeloid leukaemia.\nDemethylation gene mutations are also linked to cancers like AML through TET2 mutations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "April 2, 2018\n\nZhou W, Dinh HQ, Ramjan Z, Weisenberger DJ, Nicolet CM, Shen H, Laird PW, Berman BP. DNA methylation loss in late-replicating domains is linked to mitotic cell division. Nat Genet. 2018 Apr;50(4):591-602. doi: 10.1038/s41588-018-0073-4. Epub 2018 Apr 2. PMID: 29610480; PMCID: PMC5893360.\n\nThis study identifies four influencers of DNA methylation levels in human and mouse genomes.\n\nLocal sequence context of the CpG dinucleotide\nCpG density and the WCGW sequence context strongly influence the rate of DNA methylation loss at individual CpGs within the Partially Methylated Domains (PMDs). Their influences are constant between cell types and species. Solo-WCGW CpGs are prone to hypomethylation, possibly because DNMT1 has increased efficiency when there are multiple CpG sites close together.CpG flanked by A or T\n\n\nTiming of DNA replication\nReplication timing is a determinant of methylation levels at H3K36me3 negative CpGs like Solo-WCGW CpGs. Replication late in the S phase does not give the cell enough time to remethylate the daughter strands. Methylation during mitosis can be slow and may not fully be completed until the S-G2 checkpoint.\n\n\nH3K36me3 histone mark\nThe presence of H3K36me3 can override the methylation loss associated with late-replication. H3K36me3 helps to maintain DNA methylation at marked CpGs by the recruitment of DNMT3B to the trimethylated nucleosomes. In carcinomas with NSD1 mutations and loss of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, there is a loss of DNA methylation in areas of typically high methylation.\n\n\nAccumulated number of cell divisions\nPMD hypomethylation can accumulate despite DNA methylation maintenance machinery - genes associated with cell division and proliferation are also associated with PMD hypomethylation. The cumulative cell divisions can be a driver of PMD hypomethylation."

    "text": "Genome Research\nOct 25, 2015\n\nProblems with bulk methods\nBulk methods lose important detail because of averaging that results in the potential for losing interpretability or making wrong conclusions from the data. In Simpson’s Paradox a group of cells may show a certain gene expression pattern or correlation. However that pattern can be lost or reversed when they are grouped by their cell type. Averaging also loses information about cell counts and can lead to spurious patterns in the data since it does not account for cell death or divisions. Time series experiments, when averaged, would only show a mixture of cells rather than a better representation of the expression changes as the cells differentiate over time.\n\n\nTechnological advances in cellular state measurement\nMost assays require more cell material than is available from a single cell. This problem has been overcome through advances in amplification methods, modifications to reverse transcriptase and instrument development to capture individual cells.\nData analysis in single-cell experiments are significantly more challenging than bulk experiments since it can be highly variable and hard to distinguish between technical and biological variation. Some of these problems can be solved by normalization techniques like spike-ins or molecular barcoding. Further, since the data is orders of magnitude larger and algorithms need to be particularly efficient with dealing with that data.\n\n\nA dynamical systems view of the cell\nDynamical systems are used to predict complex behaviour and can be used as a model for cell states and trajectories. As a cell develops and regulates gene expression, its trajectory shape is a function of its starting position and the differential equations that dictate changes in its future expression levels given its current state.\nDistinct cell types can be described as attractors of the system that is a location that a cell will move toward or return to if disturbed - trajectories flow towards attractors. These can be used to describe a cell’s landscape with cell fates and paths between them.\n\n\nSingle-cell clustering and trajectory analysis\nTranscriptomic studies show that cells are part of that dynamical landscape and can be anywhere in it, and are not always in distinct and defined states. Attractors of such a landscape can be identified through clustering methods like PCA. These dimensionality reduction techniques can help deal with the “curse of dimensionality” In biological systems, genes can be grouped into modules that correlated expression levels allowing one gene to represent a group, further reducing dimensionality.Distances between points become increasingly similar as the dimensions of their space increase\nClustering could also be used to understand cell transition paths. Algorithms like Monocle can cluster cells not only by their type, but also by their temporal or developmental stage through pseudotime, a measure of biological progression through a cellular process. This can be done using transcriptomic data as well as with proteomic data.\n\n\nFinding genes that govern a cell state\nTo identify genes that determine where a cell is on the dynamical landscape, we need to be able to distinguish between genes differentially expressed during transitions between states and genes that are ‘always on’ or constitutively expressed.\nThis distinguishing process can be difficult because of the curse of dimensionality that makes it hard to predict gene-gene interactions and because averaging loses the source of variation needed to construct gene regulatory networks."

    "text": "Development\nJune 27, 2019\nCells can exist in a range of phenotypes and expression profiles, within one cell type. This review introduces a framework to understand cell state and identity using cell phenotype and function, cell lineage, and cell state. This allows mapping the landscape of cell states and will allow for a better understanding of cells that leave the normal landscape and enter diseased states.\n\nPhenotype and function\nCell phenotypes like morphology are most commonly and easily used to classify cells by their morphology and activity. We can also use the transcriptome and proteome as part of the classification process since these are higher dimensional and have more features to define cell types. Single-cell transcriptomic information can provide even more information that bulk studies to help generate a rigorous and unbiased picture of cell phenotypes. Maintaining spatial information in single-cell transcriptomics can be a challenge since the process involves separating the cells, but there are new techniques that allow for in situ visualization of cellular features.\nCell function is an important determinant of cell identity. Cellular function can be investigated through genetic ablation or or the elimination of cells, but they have their limitations, especially in humans. However, it is not easy to understand the function of a new cell type without a large number of assays. In these situations, gene ontology studies can help provide an idea of the pathways that cell is involved in based on gene expression patterns. Although this can be helpful it does not provide a clear definition of cellular function. Proteins are the effectors of cellular function in cells so they could be used as predictors of cellular function.\n\n\nCell lineage\nIf measurements of cellular phenotype yield a new cell type, it is important to place the new cell type in the context of other cells. This can be achieved by understanding the cells developmental lineage which would provide clues to function. Cell lineages and fates can be tracked in a number of different ways. The tracking data can show an expected lineage or it may show that cells of different origins end up in a similar fate or that cells from similar embryonic origins end up at vastly different states.\nWe can use snRNA-seq data to make temporal reconstructions of lineage. This results are, however, inferred and would need in vitro models of human development to validate and bolster. Combining lineage data with phenotype and function data, we can produce a fairly robust picture of cell identity.\n\n\nCell state\nCell state is the “range of cellular phenotypes arising from the interaction of a defined cell type with its environment”. Cells of a certain type can change their behaviour and expression profile depending on their environment. Cell identity is generally stable while cell state is more malleable and adjusts, making just scRNA-seq data insufficient to call a cell type with confidence. Epigenetic signatures, in combination with RNA data, can provide more information about chromatic accessibility and methylation and reveal transcriptional states associated with them. Technological improvements that allow ‘multi-omic’ measurements from a single-cell will allow more robust associations between epigenetic signatures and transcriptional states. Further, lineage mapping can be applied to cells with the introduction of perturbations to track the cell’s response and its trajectory through its landscape and will allow us to better understand the paths that lead to disease states.eg: ATAC-seq, methylation data"

PMID: 34435732; PMCID: PMC8388041.\n\nAugust 26, 2021\nRNA velocity models cellular direction and speed in transcriptome space through the ratio between spliced and unspliced mRNA and its relation to a model. Positive velocity is interpreted as upregulation while negative velocity is interpreted as downregulation. The two main approaches to RNA velocity are the steady-state model and the dynamical model. The steady-state method uses an observed steady-state between spliced and unspliced mRNA to fit a linear model and set the threshold for positive and negative velocities. This assumes that the steady-state can be observed and that the splicing rates are the same across all genes. If these assumptions are violated, however, the model is prone to errors in velocity estimates and cellular state predictions.\n\nCurrent limitations\nThe dynamical model relaxes the steady-state assumption for a more generalized model of estimation to capture heterogeneous subpopulation and cell-cycle dynamics. However, it still maintains a deterministic system of differential equations and constant kinetic rate parameters. A number of cells have multiple kinetic rates in the same gene or transcriptional boosts that are not accurately captured by the model. The model also has trouble with fully mature cell types, predicting arbitrary directions for them. Systems with complex kinetics like frequently changing kinetic rates are also not well modelled by the existing methods.\nThe statistical power of RNA velocity depends on the curvature of the phase portrait used to decide up or down-regulation. This curvature can be affected by the time variable kinetic rates of transcription, splicing and degradation. Some changes results in curvature reduction which reduces statistical power. Others result in a curve flip which changes some positive velocities to negative ones and leads to incorrect interpretations of such velocities as downregulation.\n\n\nExtensions and future directions\n\nStochastic model\nThe current RNA velocity models use simple first-order equations with constant kinetic rates, despite the fact that only a few genes can be captured with this simple system. Future extensions need to account for dynamic changes in kinetic rates to improve velocity predictions, accounting for alternative processes that modulate transcription, splicing and degradation. Identifying time variable rates will also need constraints like a pseudotime prior.\n\n\nMultivariate models towards system dynamics\nTranscriptional and post-transcriptional regulations affect dynamic changes in gene expression. The current models treat each gene independently and ignore regulatory relationships. A multivariate model can describe cell-state transitions and the regulatory interactions involved in the transitions. We can see regulatory events in a trajectory as expression changes along pseudotime. The best model would model both the RNA velocities and the regulatory network from observed expression and kinetics models. Inclusion of other modalities like chromatin modifications and RNA polymerase activity can provide significant support.\n\n\nMulti-modal omics models\nIn addition to the unspliced and spliced data we can also use other modalities like protein dynamics. In general modalities that can capture abundance, of which intronic reads are only noisy approximations, can be used to improve velocity modelling. For intronic reads, improved preprocessing may be helpful in reducing noise.\n\n\n\nTechnical challenges and extensions\nCell size normalization is currently used, but it can distort size effects. Changes in global factors like splicing efficiency or RNA polymerase abundance can affect kinetics and need to be accounted for in the model. Current models do not deal with batch effects since applying a correction to spliced and unspliced independently may reduce the information we have between them. Gene selecting can also affect the predictions since only genes that capture data variability are kept.\nIf whole cell isolation is hard to isolate, single nuclei can be used. However, they are not necessarily representative and can distort the spliced/unspliced ratio and assumptions about constant kinetics and nuclear export are not verified."

PMID: 30089906; PMCID: PMC6130801.\n\nAugust 8, 2018\nRNA abundance is an indicator of cell state and single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to capture cell-level RNA levels. To go beyond the static picture that RNA sequencing provides, distinguishing unspliced and spliced mRNAs can be used to predict a future cell state.\nmRNA introns are spliced out after transcription to form spliced mRNA which is then degraded. The change in spliced mRNA can be modelled as\n\\[ \\frac{ds}{dt} = u - \\gamma s \\]\nwhere\n\n\\(u\\) is the unspliced mRNA,\n\\(\\gamma\\) is the spliced mRNA degradation rate, and\n\\(s\\) is the spliced mRNA.\n\nThe quantity of spliced mRNA at a certain timepoint is correlated with and can be predictive of the quantity of unspliced mRNA at the next timepoint. Knowing how much unspliced mRNA there is for a gene at one point means we can predict whether that gene is actively expressed or was previously expressed and will not be expressed in the future. Coupled with information on genes that define cell states and types, we can show the trajectory a cell will take in the near future. RNA velocity allows us to understand what the origin of different cell types and states are before we have information about the developmental process .\nComputed velocities can be projected onto low dimensional embeddings of data like a PCA to visualise the trajectories between different cell states. However, since they are low dimensional, the trajectories may not be fully representative and would need examination in different dimensional combinations (eg: PC2 vs PC3)."

    "text": "Nature biotechnology\nAugust 3, 2022\nRNA velocity is the change in mRNA abundance. This depends on the ratio between spliced and unspliced mRNA and the assumption that they reach a steady-state. Velocities are determined as the deviation of the observed ratio from the steady-state ratio. This depends on the gene-level capture of the full splicing dynamics with transcriptional induction, repression and steady-state mRNA levels and on all genes sharing a common splicing rate. While RNA velocity prediction allows us to see how cells change their state, the base algorithm does not do well when the assumptions of a common splicing rate or having the full splicing dynamics are violated. Further, not all experiments are done in a time-frame that involves reaching the steady-state.\nscVelo uses a likelihood-based dynamical model rather than a steady-state model that solves the problems with those assumptions. It works by generalizing RNA velocity estimation to transient systems and systems whose subpopulation kinetics are heterogeneous. They can infer gene-specific reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation. They can also infer the underlying gene-shared latent time which represents the cell’s internal clock that describes the cell’s position in the underlying biological processes. This is different from existing pseudotime methods because it is based only on transcriptional dynamics and takes both speed and direction into account. Dynamical modelling allows for delineating cell cycling, lineage commitment, cell cycle exit and endocrine differentiation. This method, however, still assumes constant reaction rate and is limited by alternative splicing."

This phenotype is particularly enhanced by the gain of “oncogenic RAS or loss of p53 function”.\nWhile there were differences between the way the phenotype was expressed between different cells, there were also similarities between them indicating that there is a “conserved core secretory program that any cell undergoing senescence would trigger”. They all had “high levels of secreted inflammatory cytokines, immune modulators, and gwowth factors, suggenting that SASPs might have myriad biological activities”. They found that tumor cells were very likely to become senescent in response to DNA damage. Senescent cells create a “proinflammatory environment”.\nAlthough senescent cells tend to be removed by the immune system, they increase in number with age. This may be because aging or age-related related pathologies dampen immune response and/or increase the rate at which senescent cells are produced.\nThe authors suggest that senescence has both beneficial and detrimental effects because of antagonistic pleiotropy which may be explained as a “consequence of the declining force of natural selection with age.” Older individuals are fewer in number because of extrinsic hazards and natural selection tends to favor traits that promote “early life fitness” at the cost of longevity."

Thus, cellular senescence might participate in four complex biological processes (tumor suppression, tumor promotion, aging, and tissue repair), some of which have apparently opposing effects.

However, these markers of senescence are not universal and are not a good way to ensure that a cell is senescent.\nThis study used universally expressed transcripts from different senescent cell models and, using RNA-seq, found RNAs that could be used to identify senescent cells.\nThe main differences in RNA expression depended on the cell type of origin, and not on the senescence induction method which supports the idea that senescence is not a single phenotypic state.\nThe RNA-seq analysis revealed 50 elevated and 18 reduced transcripts between the senescent and non-senescent cells, some of which were consistent between all senescence models and were more uniform than the p21 and p16 markers.\nExamining the 68 transcripts shared between the senescent types, a PCA showed that senescence state gave the clearest separation between the cell types. An ML models using LASSO showed that 5 transcripts, SLCO2B1, CLSTN2, PTCHD4 mRNAs and LINCO2154 and PURPL lncRNAs, were the minimum needed to distinguish senescent cells. PURPL was one of the most highly and consistently elevated transcripts and is controlled by the transcription factor p53, which is elevated in senescent cells.

In WT mice senescent cells made up 10% of the examined tissue while in the preforin knockout mice, it was 43% at 24 months. The expression of p16, another senescence marker, increased more in the KO mice than the WT. This senescence increase was tested with a number of other known senescence markers and shown to be consistent.\nAlong with the increase in senescent cell numbers, there was also an increase in age-dependent chronic inflammation with increased cytokine expression and more tissue-infiltrating immune cells. In 24 month-old mice there was an increase in serum cytokine levels and pro-inflammatory factors, but not in 2 and 12 month-old mice. The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is accompanied by an increased inflammatory response.\nLoss of perforin also resulted in age-related disorders like fibrosis in various organs, loss of the subcutaneous fat layer, and loss of hair follicles. An examination of their blood for tissue damage markers found tissue damage in internal organs as well as increased urea levels, probably from kidney damage. The KO mice were less active and had poorer grip strength and coordination that the WT mice. Further, these mice also had a decreased lifespan than the WT mice.\nThey also used a mouse with the LMNA gene mutation which resulted in senescent cell accumulation. These mice, when crossed with those with the preforin deficiency, acquired the deficiency and their lifespans were shorter than the mice with just the LMNA gene mutation. This suggests that despite an increased senescent cell burden, a functioning immune surveillance system can help to slow senescence-induced ageing."

PMID: 31945125; PMCID: PMC6964973.\n\nA study showed that glioblastoma cells undergo senescence and develop the SASP which promotes tumor growth in the brain. The authors of this paper asked whether this senescence could contribute to neurodegeneration since astrocyte senescence has been observed in AD patients.\nThey used X-irradiation to induce senescence in astrocytes. Since astrocytes maintain glutamate, potassium and water homeostasis, they tested how senescence would affect the expression of genes involved in these homeostatic processes. Examining the excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2, their qPCR showed that in senescent astrocytes these genes were downregulated.\nUsing RNA-seq, they checked whether senescence affected these homeostatic pathways. Senescence markers like p16INK4a mRNA were significantly increased in the senescent astrocytes and lamin B1 was decreased according to expectations since they were both known senescence markers.\nDisease enrichment analysis on the differentially upregulated genes showed that they were involved in cancer, infectious disease or AD. The downregulated genes were involved in cancer and neurological disease. Using a dataset from NetWork Glia they filtered for Transporter associated astrocyte enriched genes. A gene-set enrichment analysis on this data gave a p-value of 0.08. This confirmed the downregulation of the amino acid transporters in senescent astrocytes.\nTheir next question was whether this downregulation affected glutamate uptake in astrocytes. Using a co-culture of neurons with senescent and non-senescent astrocytes, both with and without a 10mM solution of glutamate, they found that neurons died when cultured with glutamate and were in co-culture with senescent astrocytes. The senescent astrocytes did not take up glutamate efficiently leading to the death of co-cultured neurons.\nAstrocytes are important to neuron survival and this capability is compromised when they become senescent. If astrocytes are unable maintain an appropriate level of glutamate in the brain, neurons are at risk of death from excitotoxicity. The RNA-seq also found that APOE is upregulated in senescent astrocytes which could put AD patients at greater risk of losing neurons to glutamate toxicity."

The cells remained metabolically active and had a distinct vacuolated morphology.\nReplicative senescence is driven by telomere attrition that exposes the chromosome end and triggers the DNA damage response. Other types of senescence occur with exposure to stressors like oncogenic factors, oxidative stress or radiation. It is a pleiotropic phenomenon vital to embryogenesis, tumour suppression, and wound healing.\nThe persistence of senescence cells without clearance by the immune system can lead to a chronic state of senescence and inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype - a state that can spread senescence to neighbouring healthy cells.\nIt can be hard to determine what cellular senescence is since there is no one marker to identify it. β-galactosidase activity and p16 expression are usually used to identify senescent cells, but these markers are not unique or always found in senescent cells.

OPCs are responsible for the myelination of neurons in the brain when they differentiate into oligodendrocytes in response to microglial signalling. Senescent microglia show dysfunctional degradation which inhibits OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. OPC senescence is associated with ageing and exposure to amyloid-beta oligomers, with expression of p16, p21 and senescence-associated beta galactosidase. Some SASP components secreted by senescent cells could interfere with myelination. Senescence also affects other cells like astrocytes, microglia and neurons. Treating senescent astrocytes with rapamycin restored astrocyte ability to support OPC differentiation. Senescence in the BBB increases its permeability and the entry of fibrinogen can interfere with the differentiation of OPCs and affect remyelination. Treatments with senolytics reduced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits which shows that senescence could contribute to the state of neuroinflammation and to the loss of cognitive function.\nMyelin is negatively related to age and loss of myelin could contribute to AD pathology. A number of cell types have been shown to become senescent on exposure to amyloid or tau in AD brains and other papers have shown that myelin disruption is found in AD and could be an early feature. TREM2 which is an AD associated gene is involved in myelin debris removal. When the myelin debris overwhelms microglia, they can become senescent and myelination an be affected."

However, the SASP can also promote tumorigenic processes like angiogenesis and invasion. During ageing the SASP can lead to chronic inflammation and spread of senescence into neighboring cells. lncRNAs could be important in regulating SASP genes. MIR310HG knock-down in BRAF-induced senescent fibroblasts reduced expression and secretion of SASP components.\nThey found that MIR310HG depletion during oncogene induced senescence affected the SASP as they did not upregulate the main components of the SASP. These cells without the MIR310HG produced less IL6 and CXCL1, SASP inflammatory factors.\nTheir examination of the paracrine effects of MIR310HG showed that the knock-down did not affect the senescence but did affect the induction of paracrine invasion. The depletion also resulted in reduced CEBPB and NF-κB activation in oncogene-induced senescence as well as decreased IL1A translation.\nSenescence-targeting therapies try to affect the SASP without changing the tumor-suppressive benefits of senescence and MIR310HG is able to reduce senescence invasion without affecting the growth arrest.

The examination of their brains revealed that they had gliosis, mircogliosis and axonal damage. rnaSeq showed that 24 hours after the injuries, the DDR was activated and cell-cycle arrest induced. Seven days after the injuries, more genes were found to be significantly different between the two mice groups. There was an increase in cellular senescence-related genes as well as genes known to be risk factors and biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Several of these genes are associated with AD-like pathology which shows that neurodegenerative processes may begin as soon as a week after the injury.

Senolytics can be used to target senescence, but more work need to be done to understand what cells to target therapeutically.\nImmunosenescence is the decline in immune function with ageing and the development of senescence that increase disease susceptibility and contribute to mortality.\nERCC1 is involved in the repair of DNA damage and reducing its expression can lead to the accumulation of oxidative lesions and senescent cells that then cause age-associated pathologies. This study used mice with ERCC1 removed from lymphoid organs that showed an accelerated ageing phenotype.\n\nImmune system changes\nThe fraction of T cells was reduced in these mice at 4-5 months and T cells and B cells were reduced in older mutant mice unlike WT mice. Natural killer cytotoxicity was impaired in the mutant mice showing unhealthy immune ageing. Overall the ERCC1 deletion caused accelerated ageing in the mice immune system and shows that the immune system is vulnerable to DNA damage.\np16 and p21 were significantly reduced in B and T cells, natural killer cells and in macrophages along with an increase in SASP expression. p16 was found in the liver, kidneys, and the lungs. SA-β-galactosidase was increased in renal tubules and the liver.\nThe mutant mice were poorer muscle regeneration after injury as well as reduced grip strength. They also had a shorter lifespan than the control mice showing that an aged immune system can lead to the loss of homeostasis and damage in peripheral organs, negatively affecting lifespan.\n\n\nCell non-autonomous mechanism\nThe authors transplanted splenocytes from the mutant mice and two-year-old WT mice into p16Ink4a luciferase reporter mice. The mutant splenocytes had increased levels of luciferase signal than those from controls. SASP protein levels were also increased in the recipients of mutant splenocytes. These results show that senescent immune cells can drive ageing and affect lifespan.\n\n\nCell autonomous mechanism\nThen they also transplanted splenocytes from young WT mice into the mutant mice. This resulted in the mutant mice showing reduced senescence and SASP factors levels. This also reduced p16 and p21 mRNA in mutant mice supporting the idea that a loss-of-function mechanism is involved in the inability of aged immune cells to suppress senescence.\n\n\nRapamycin rejuvenation\nRapamycin is used in elderly people to improve their immune response to flu vaccination. The mutant mice were treated with rapamycin and their immune response was improved and p16 and p21 expression was reduced suggesting a modulation of the gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms through which senescence drives ageing.\nThe study concluded that immune cells are vulnerable to endogenous DNA damage that can cause cell death or senescence if left unrepaired. Immunosenescence affects innate and adaptive immunity and drives senescence and age-related changes in solid organs."

The response to these lesions is the axon reaction and includes metabolic and structural changes in the lesioned nerve cells and an activation of surrounding glial cells. This innate immune response can have beneficial and harmful effects.\nThey removed the ventral root in two strains of adult rats and found that the ensuing neurodegeneration had the activation of astrocytes and microglia and upregulation of immunological compounds. The DA strain represents an injury susceptible model and the PVG represents an injury resistant one. Their DA strain had more glial activation and greater lesioned motorneuron loss compared to the PVG strain. This differences between the strains could show the importance of susceptibility to inflammatory disease in humans.\nThe largest group of upregulated genes were part of an immunological and inflammatory gene group and these were more expressed in the strain susceptible to neurodegeneration."

PMID: 33671362; PMCID: PMC7922097.\n\nWhile the risks for both neurodegeneration and cancer increase with age, there is an inverse correlation between the odds of getting one or the other. A number of genes, proteins, and pathways are shared, but in opposite directions. A recent study found that the most shared risk SNPs were in the locus containing the lncRNA ANRIL that modulates cell cycle regulators like CDKN2A-B that codes for p16INK4A, a mediator of cellular senescence. Senescence may contribute towards the inverse correlation between the risks for cancer and neurodegeneration. Senescent cells could be a way to avoid cancer development, but may contribute to neurodegeneration with age.\nFor the review of the evidence of senescence in these diseases, they used cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, the SASP, and SA-β-gal as senescence markers.\nThey found some evidence to suggest that senescence protects against cancer, but they did not find enough to come to a strong conclusion. One study found that in pilocytic asrocytoma, a tumor formed from astrocytes, the presence of p16 and SA-β-gal were associated with increased patient survival. Exposure to genetic and external carcinogenic stimuli resulted in senescence markers being expressed in brain cells.\nHowever, most of the papers they read did not fully characterize senescence, using only a few markers which meant that there may have been other explanations for their results that don’t include senescence. Some markers used, like p21, are part of normal cell functioning and by themselves do not necessarily indicate senescence.\nTheir conclusion was that additional work needed to be done in the area that better identified senescence."

Epub 2020 Nov 30. PMID: 33257875.\n\nThis paper explores the role of the immune system in the brain with regards to inflammation. They found that natural killer cells played important roles in the immune surveillance of the aged brain and outnumber other immune cell types. NK cell surveillance is triggered when brain cells become senescent. NK cells play a key role in the decline of neurogenesis and cognition during normal brain ageing.\nNK cells were found to preferentially accumulate in the dentate gyrus, but not in adjacent areas. They hypothesized that there were focal factors that bridged the interactions between NK cells and dentate gyrus cells. This was confirmed by the increased presence of Ki67-expressing NK cells and higher proliferative activity of transplanted NK cells in aged dentate gyrus compared to young. Overall, normal brain ageing induces an environment that facilitates NK cell accumulation.\nCellular senescence is known to trigger Nk cell surveillance and they found NK cells close to SASP expressing neuroblasts. These cells reinforce NK cell functions and surveillance resulting in the elimination of aged neuroblasts. Restriction of NK cell activity could help facilitate neurogeneration and ameliorate neurogenerative conditions as NK cell depletion mitigated the decline in synaptic plasiticity and cognitive function."

It the brains with pathologies, they found a strong association of ferritin light chain which is responsible for storing intracellular iron with dystrophic microglia.\nThere was no clear pattern of increased microglial dystrophy with age in the hippocampus or white matter, but there was an increase in the proportion of dystrophic microglia in the frontal cortex.

The high pathology controls (HPC) had Aβ deposition and NFT formation that qualified for an AD diagnosis.\nDespite similar levels of Aβ deposition, the HPC patients showed no evidence of synapse loss, but the AD patients did. The high pathology controls also had significantly higher brain weights than those with AD.\nInflammation was measured as C5b-9 immunoreactivity and was found abundantly in AD samples. The HPC inflamamtion levels on the other hand were more comparable to those of normal controls. This immunoreactivity was the most sensitive correlate of synapse loss.

PMID: 26871627.\n\nThe linearity of the cascade remains very controversial. For instance, exploration of the direct link between Aβ and neurotoxicity has resulted in a rather confusing literature with at least ten different molecular mechanisms and receptors (see Figure 1) (Benilova et al., 2012). It is debatable whether they all equally contribute to the disease process in humans, as many of the supporting studies used non-physiologically high concentrations of Aβ or transgenic mice significantly overexpressing APP Thus, the neuron-centric view has to be expanded to one that considers the contribution of different cell types, their interactions with each other, and the gradual evolution of the disease.\nInstead of Aβ and Tau, the real causes of sporadic disease are upstream of these proteopathies and are likely manifold, with aging being the major driver.\nThis paper examines the amyloid cascade hypothesis and questions the linearity of the amyloid cascade in producing AD pathology, saying the biochemistry of the brain needs to be intergrated. They found that studies supporting the amyloid cascade hypothesis used non-physiologically high concentrations of Aβ or transgenic mice overexpressing APP. Since a lot of ‘confusing’ literature with many different molecular mechanisms have come out they are skeptical that all equally contribute to AD pathology. They also suggested that instead of Aβ and tau, the real causes of sporadic disease may be upstream of those proteopathies, with aging being the major driver of these conditions.\nIn general, they believe that the neuron-centric view needs to be expanded to consider the contribution of different cell types and interactions including astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and the role of the neurovascular unit and the vascular hypothesis of AD. With single-cell sequencing, more of these mechanisms and pathways can be explored.\nThey also suggested that instead of Aβ and tau, the real causes of sporadic disease may be upstream of those proteopathies, with aging being the major driver of these conditions."

Compared to this, the bulk analysis was only able to capture the expression from the single-cell level in exitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes, not the other cell types. Bulk sequencing could also not capture when the differentially-expressed genes had opposite directionality.\nThe authors used an unsupervised learning framework called self-organizing maps to find the gene sets with similar expression patterns that also correlated with the AD phenotype. They found that in exitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, each cell type had a distinct SOM unit which meant that different gene groups respond to AD pathology.\nExamining the pathology between sexes, they found differences in AD-associated cell subpopulations, transcriptional activations, and responses to amyloid."

Cell Death Dis. 2021 Feb 4;12(2):151. doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-03438-9. PMID: 33542214; PMCID: PMC7862496.\n\nThis study investigated the effects of an isoform of p53 on the zebrafish brain ageing, learning and memory.\nThe zebrafish Δ133p53 isoform is an ortholog of the same human isoform and is highly induced in response to low ROS levels and promotes cell survival and inhibits senescence. It is found in the telencephalon ventricular zone. Zebrafish with a mutant variant of this isoform have higher levels of ROS and show accelerated ageing. Decreased expression of human Δ113p53 is associated with replicative senescence and has been observed in the brains of patients with AD and ALS. Examining a variant of this isoform and its role in brain ageing they found that the expression of antioxidant genes significantly decreased in mutant telencephalons compared to wild type. There were increased levels of hydrogen peroxide as well as an increase in the level of SA-β-gal activity, an indicator of cellular senescence.\nThey also ran a test to see how memory and learning would be affected by the mutation. Using a swim tank, with one half colored red and the other colored white, they shocked the fish when they were in the white area. The wild type fish spent less time in the area coloured white compared to the mutant fish. Although these differences were found between the two groups, they did not find any significant differences between the DNA damage response or apoptotic activity.\nInterestingly, they also note that SIRT1, a senescence-related gene plays a protective role in neurodegenerative disease and that it was downregulated in the mutant group. This downregulation along with the increased levels of ROS could lead to increased brain ageing.\nThis paper showed how a mutation in the p53 isomer resulted in an increased risk for developing senescence and also resulted in cognitive problems. This suggests that there could be a link between an increased risk of senescence and developing cognitive problems."

This paper reviews the literature concerning TL, AD, and PD. Telomere length is maintained by telomerase and, while its activity in the brain decreases after birth, there is high activity in neuronal stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells. There are only inconsistent results between cognitive performance and TL.\nResults in AD studies have been contradictory. Telomere shortening and reduced telomerase activity was found in rat microglial cells, but in aged telomerase knockout mice had decreased progression of amyloid plaque pathology. The authors think small study cohorts may be responsible for the inconsistencies since a meta-analysis showed more consistent evidence for shorter telomeres in AD.\nThey concluded that telomere length is a questionable biomarker for clinical use because it has low specificity and sensitivity. It could still be important because it is unclear whether telomere length is a cause or consequence of age-related disorders, but should be understood in the context of other markers.\nIt was interesing because I expected telomeres to be reliable biomarkers since they are a major part of cellular senescence. However, with better methods and the longitudinal studies that the authors recommend, there may be important relationships to be discovered that could contribute to the explanation of AD pathogenesis and the role of senescence."

The inhibition of RbAp48 resulted in poorer novel object recognition performance.\nIn the Morris water maze, after one day of learning, the transgenic mice showed impaired memory, but no noncognitive differences.\n\n\nMemory deficits in the transgenic and aged mice\nAged mice showed memory deficits similar to the young transgenic mice and had similar performances as the young mice in learning tasks. The inhibition of RbAp48 in the forebrain leads to the cognitive defects characteristic of hippocampal ageing.\n\n\nEffects of the dominant-negative in the DG\nCompared to control mice, the transgenic mice showed selective dysfunction in the DG which was reversed when the dominant-negative gene was turned off.\n\n\nEffect of RbAp48-DN on histone acetylation in the DG\nExamination of the acetylation of H4 and H2B showed that RbAp48 inhibition caused a reduction in acetylation. This was also reversible when RbAp48-DN expression was turned off.\n\n\nEffect of upregulating RbAp48 in aged mice\nIncreasing RbAp48 in the DG improved memory performance in the novel object recognition test and the water test.\n\n\nEffect of RbAp48-DN expression in the forebrain on HAT activity of CBP\nThe CBP HAT activity was lower in the DG of the transgenic mice, but the amount of CBP protein was the same. A selective reduction of CBP HAT activity in the DG was found in aged WT mice."

These effects were reversed in by increasing RbAp48 abundance.\nThese results show that RbAp48 in the DG is necessary for hippocampal functioning. They also suggest that age-related memory loss is independent of AD and since other studies have not implicated RbAp48, these results show that they have distinct mechanisms.\nSince RbAp48 works through the PKA-CREB1-CBP pathway which is important to age-related memory loss in mice, it could be a potential therapeutic avenue. Enhancing he CREB1 pathway reduces age-related hippocampal dysfunction in rodents and could have benefits for humans."
