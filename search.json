JSONB objects with PostgreSQL had faster write performance followed by MongoDB and PostgreSQL.\n\n\nIndex Creation\nThe time needed to create an index on the dbSNP data depended on the field used to create it on. For the JSONB PostgreSQL implementation, the Generalized Inverted Index method provided the best indexing results on the clinical significance or the gene name. Since the GIN cannot make a unique index, when the RSID field was indexed, it was significantly slower than the other databases.\n\n\nQuery performance\nMongoDB performed best on all but complex queries while MySQL has the lowest. For the complex query, PostgreSQL with JSONB was the fastest. Overall the document based models were significantly faster than the relational ones."

    "text": "DNA methylation mechanism\nWhile genetic mechanisms of oncogenesis are more easily seen and understood, epigenetic mechanisms can be powerful ones that can be transferred through cell divisions. Mutations in epigenetic regulators are important and lead to major changes in cancer cell epigenomes. Genetic mechanisms can inactivate tumor-suppressor genes or work with epigenetic mechanisms to make mutations and epigenetic dsyregulation more likely.\n\nCpG cytosine-5 methylation\nThis is catalysed by DNMT3A and DNMT3B and maintained by DNAMT3B. Most of the mammalian genome is not methylated. The sparse methylated regions contain heavily methylated CpG dinucleotides and unmethylated CpG islands that are protected from DNA methylation by guanine-cytosine strand asymmetry and R loop formation. There may also be active demethylation by TET proteins. CpG islands are present on the start sites of half of human genes - genes that are actively expressed or about to be.\nMethyl-CpG binding domains (MBD) or C2H2 zinc fingers recognize methylation DNA. MBDs and Kaiso (zinc finger) are involved in DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes with promoter DNA methylation.\n\n\nHistone variants and modifications\nHistone modifications are carried out by histone methyltransferases demethylases, acetyltransferases and deacetylases, and writers and erasers of phosphorylation and other modifications. They act in complexes like the Polycomb complex and counterbalance each other to regulate developmental genes, some of which are implicated in cancer. The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) allows PRC1 to dock. PRC1 has a RING1B enzymatic core that monoubiquitinylates histone H2A at K119 and blocks RNA polymerase II elongation. The H3K4 methylation mark made by the Trithorax group complex counters Polycomb function. PRC2 targets embryonic stem cell transcription factors for differentiation and development regulators with the activating H3K4me3 and the repressive H3K27me3 marks. The Trithorax demethylase KDM6A can remove this repressive mark allowing for gene transcription for differentiation. Genes not needed for this process lose the activating mark and gain the repressive one.\nHistone variants are found in different cell types and regions. Some like H2A.Z are found in regions requiring frequent changes and wide prevalence indicates prevalent chromatin exchange in embryonic stem cells.\n\n\nNucleosome positioning and remodelling\nNucleosome position can influence transcriptional activation and repression. There are chromatin remodelling complexes (SWI/SNF, chromodomain and helicase-like domain(CHD), ISWI and INO80) that can change nucleosome positions\nOther epigenetic changes include:\n\nHydroxylation\nFormylation\nCarboxylation\n\nThese changes are made by\n\ninitiators like lncRNAs,\nwriters establish marks, guided by sequence context, existing marks and bound proteins, ncRNAs, or nuclear architecture. Mutations to writers like DNMT3A are often found in cancers and\n\nreaders that interpret them,\nerasers like TET that remove them,\nremodelers that reposition nucleosomes and\nInsulators\nInsulators form boundaries between epigenetic domains and include the CCCTC-binding factor CTCF and CTCFL/BORIS. CTCF prevents enhancer interactions with unintended promoters. It also separates active and repressive chromatin domains.\n\n\n\nEpigenetic state maintainance\nThe epigenome is copied between cell divisions by DNMT1 and H3K9 methyltransferase which are loaded into the replication fork and copy the marks. The Trithorax and Polycomb complexes are recruited during replication and distributed between the daughter cells to restore marks."

    "section": "Epigenetic disruption in cancer",
    "text": "Epigenetic disruption in cancer\nStudies have found contradictory changes in DNA methylation in cancer. Some find hypomethylation while others find hypermethylation of CpG islands. We know epigenetic changes can be causal in cancer since many tumor-supressor genes have been silenced by promoter CpG islands hypermethylation independent of mutational or structural inactivation of the gene. Further mouse models need epigenetic readers and writers for tumor development. Some methylation changes are essential for cancer cell survival.\n\nDisruption of differentiation and development\nPolycomb repressors mark differentiation and development regulator genes depending on that cells trajectory. These genes tend to be hypermethylated in their CpG islands during proliferation, ageing and malignant transformation. Cancer cells also show silencing of differentiation genes. This suggests a model where Polycomb target genes in stem cells acquire permanent silencing over time and lose their ability to differentiate, but are still able to proliferate. This would mean that it is an epigenetic modification rather than a genetic one that leads to malignant transformation.\n\n\nCpG island methylator phenotypes\nThe CpG island methylator phenotype shows a high frequency of CpG island hypermethylation. There are distinct epigenetic subtypes for some cancers like CRC and glioblastoma, while others like ovarian cancer do not show such distinct subtypes.\n\n\nEpigenetic influences on genomic integrity\nEpigenetic mechanisms can affect the rates of lesion formation and repair. Methylated and unmethylated cytosine can both be deaminated. Unmethylated C forms uracil and 5mC forms thymine. Since uracil is not part of normal DNA is it more likely to be found and repaired than a change to thymine which leads to a 10-fold higher rate of C-to-T mutations in CpG dinucleotides that mostly contain MeC than other SNVs in the genome. The deamination of 5mC before replication leads to a normal T:A base that is not a repair candidate. About a quarter of TP53 mutations in cancer result from this epigenetic mark.\n\n\nRegional effects of chromatic organization\nMegabase regions of repressive chromatin (H3K9me3) are correlated with cancer SNVs. Genes resistant to cancer-associated hypermethylation tend to have retrotransposons near their transcription start sites compared to methylation-prone genes. Mouse models of DNMT deficiency tend to have chromosomal instability.\n\n\nEpigenetic influences on DNA repair\nRemoval of DNA methyltransferases can lead to increased microsatellite instability (MSI), increased telomere lengths and telomeric recombination. The epigenetic silencing of DNA repair genes like MLH1 can lead to an increase in mutation rates and genomic instability in cancer cells.\nMutations of epigenetic regulator genes like writers and erasers can be mechanisms of oncogenesis. DNMT3A and TET2 mutations have been found in cancers.\nHistone gene mutations can also be involved in cancer as they affect histone positioning and telomeres. Some like the K27M mutation mimic a Polycomb repressive mark. Histone methylation writer mutations like in MLL are found in leukemias. This may work by the inappropriate recruitment of epigenetic factors to MLL targets. Some writers like EZH2 have both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in cancer. This may be part of a control system with different functions in different environments that are dysregulated when mutations occur in these genes.\nChromatin remodelling involves remodelling the structure and positioning of nucleosomes to enable access. Chromatin remodeler mutations are implicated in a number of different cancers. SWI/SNF complexes are remodelers with mutations in rhabdoid tumors."

Epub 2019 Aug 9. PMID: 31399642.\n\nNature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology\nDNA methylation of the 5mC is associated with transcriptional repression and through that repression affects genomic imprinting X chromosome inactivation, repressing transposons and germline-specific genes. The methylation enables a higher mutation rate as 5mC is deaminated to a thymine, which when paired with A, is not easily repaired. Most cancer types show a dysregulation of DNA methylation.\nThe mammalian genome undergoes major epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization and germline cell specification.\n\nCellular functions of DNA methylation\nDNMT3A and DNMT3B are the two major de novo DNA methylation enzymes. They have a highly conserved methyltransferase domain and two chromatin reading domains.\nThe bodies of actively transcribed genes are enriched with DNA methylation, while active promoters are unmethylated. De novo methylation can occur in any sequence context, but only the methylation in CpG contexts are preserved through cell division by the methylation maintenance enzyme DNMT1 working with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1.\nDemethylation is done by TET that oxidises methylated cytosine. Oxidised forms of C can promote demethylation during replication.\nGene bodies tend to be quite heavily methylated which is paradoxical since methylation makes mutagenesis more likely. It may be because it facilitates transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing. It may also repress intragenic cryptic promoters.\n\nCpG-island promoter methylation\nMost of mammalian promoters are CpG-islands that are rarely methylated. They are methylated in the cases on X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and in germline specific genes.\nGenomic imprinting is when genes expression is controlled based on whether the gene was inherited from the father or mother. Germline-specific genes need to be repressed with the onset of somatic differentiation during implantation.\n\n\nRetrotransposons\nThe main targets of DNA methylation are retrotransposons that occupy around half of the genomic space. Their expression is controlled by CpG-rich promoters whose methylation is necessary for silencing them. DNMT3C is a newly discovered de novo DNMT specifically working to control retrotransposons. DNA methylation also serves to inactivate retrotransposons through increased mutagenesis by deamination.\n\n\n\nMethylation patterning in development\nReprogramming occurs first after fertilization where the embryo loses gamete-specific DNA methylation patterns. Then there is a gradual loss of methylation until the blastocyst stage. However, there remains substantial methylation after the global demethylation processes which could possibly imply the existence of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.\nSex-specific patterns of methylation are established in germlines. Sperm have 80% CpG methylation while oocytes have 50% methylation.\n\n\nMethylation and disease\nDNMT1 mutations are associated with neurological disorders like hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy 1E with dementia and hearing loss. DNMT3B mutations are found in immunodeficiency diseases. Heterozygous, germline mutations in DNMT3A are associated with growth disorders of early prenatal onset. Somatic mutations of this gene are linked to adult cancers like acute myeloid leukaemia.\nDemethylation gene mutations are also linked to cancers like AML through TET2 mutations."

Solo-WCGW CpGs are prone to hypomethylation, possibly because DNMT1 has increased efficiency when there are multiple CpG sites close together.CpG flanked by A or T\n\n\nTiming of DNA replication\nReplication timing is a determinant of methylation levels at H3K36me3 negative CpGs like Solo-WCGW CpGs. Replication late in the S phase does not give the cell enough time to remethylate the daughter strands. Methylation during mitosis can be slow and may not fully be completed until the S-G2 checkpoint.\n\n\nH3K36me3 histone mark\nThe presence of H3K36me3 can override the methylation loss associated with late-replication. H3K36me3 helps to maintain DNA methylation at marked CpGs by the recruitment of DNMT3B to the trimethylated nucleosomes. In carcinomas with NSD1 mutations and loss of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, there is a loss of DNA methylation in areas of typically high methylation.\n\n\nAccumulated number of cell divisions\nPMD hypomethylation can accumulate despite DNA methylation maintenance machinery - genes associated with cell division and proliferation are also associated with PMD hypomethylation. The cumulative cell divisions can be a driver of PMD hypomethylation."

PMID: 36347867; PMCID: PMC9643452.\n\nNature Communications\nZhou et al. showed that there is a loss of DNA methylation at certain regions of the genome that they suggested was caused by mitosis. This paper experimentally shows that this loss is driven by cellular division independent of time. Methylation loss is negatively correlated with population doubling in a cell culture. It occurs more at solo-WGCWs, lone CG dinucleotides within a 35-bp region flanked by A or T nucleotides, than at social WGCWs. The loss is greater at regions that replcate late than earlier replication regions, which they believe is indicative of poor maintenance methylation and possibly chromatin inaccessibility. Most domains with solo-WGCWs are gene-poor, but those with highly expressed genes had lower rates of methylation loss in a cell-type specific manner. Stopping DNA replication stops the methylation loss. Ambient oxygen concentrations for cell culture lead to increased rates of methylation loss.\nUsing the collected methylation data, they build a model using elastic net regression to predict relative mitotic history. It performed better than other existing methods that were trained on comparisons between different time points, unlike this model which is based on measured cell divisions. It is however, best suited to single cell type populations since it was trained on homogeneious primary cell culture."

PMID: 36973557.\n\nAlthough single-cell data provides data at high resolution, sparsity, noise and heterogeneity in the data can make it difficult to analyze the data and draw conclusions. Each individual cluster can have multiple distinct gene expression programs with important biological function. This paper uses the metacell concept to group cell states that are similar as units that can then be used for analysis. Using metacells instead of individual cells improves the results from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.\n\nMetacells are far more granular than clusters and are optimized for homogeneity within cell groups rather than for separation between clusters.\n\nThe SEACells tools identifies metacells across the phenotypic manifold, a lower dimensional manifold. They use a matrix decomposition method called archetypal analysis which is usually used to identify the cell states at the boundaries of the phenotypic space. They use it differently by applying it on a cell-cell similarity matrix. Metacells work by projecting the data into a higher dimension where the differences between cells are exaggerated to find the groups of cells that best make up a discrete and truly similar group:\n\ntwo cells are alike only if they share neighbors and the distances to the shared neighbors are similar.\n\nThese metacells can distinguish states within cell types and capture rare cell states as well as intermediate cells in low-density regions.\nOne of the main applications of SEACells is gene regulatory inference from scATAC-seq data. This is done by identifying transcription factor binding motifs of accessible chromatin regions from ATAC-seq data. scATAC-seq suffers from sparsity issues, but SEACells balances resolution with coverage to overcome sparsity. They found that using only nucleosome-free fragments from the data performed better than using all fragments at resolving regulatory elements. Gene regulators are identified by the correlation between accessibility and expression. Using ATAC metacells captures correlations that were not found at the single-cell level. SEACells can also model gene accessibility dynamics during differentiation in the chromatin landscape.\nSEACells can also be used to integrate data from multiple sources with different sources of variation into metacells. They used COVID single-cell data from different locations and time-points. Batch effects were lower in metacells than the single-cells. Even a confounding factor turned out to be caused by differences measurement time along disease-progression showing that SEACells can preserve biological signal despite technical noise.\nFurther, since metacells are summarized from single-cell data, using metacells instead of single-cell’s can increase compuational efficiency when large numbers of cells are involved. They can also be aggregated into metacell aggregates ‘meta2cells’. In the COVID dataset, this double aggregation was used to capture both healthy and COVID metacells in combination to show how healthy cells change in COVID."

PMID: 27616569.\n\nNature Reviews Genetics\nWaddington’s landscape shows how a progenitor cell may choose one of four paths as the path a ball rolling down a hill takes is influenced by the terrain. The biological terrain is made of genetic regulatory networks that shape the cell’s trajectory. This analogy, while intuitive, is hard to implement as a model since cellular potential cannot be calculated. Further, rather than passively sliding into the nearest channel, cells may need to jump into the next state.\nCells can change their state through stochastic fluctuations that are an intrinsic part of biological systems. These fluctuations disturb the landscape and drive cells towards one state or another. Cells can also change their state based on changes to the landscape itself that affect the number of available states or the ease with which some states are reached. Knowing the underlying regulatory network allows us to predict behaviour.\n Single-cell RNA sequencing captures transcriptional information with cellular resolution and these studies have shown that, in general, differential expression profiles make up cell types. However, even within cell types of a certain expression profile, there remains transcriptional heterogeneity. Some of this is technical noise, but it could also represent a transition state where the cell is making a decision about its next state. The transition state contains the same cell type expressing different genes in varying levels. These cells can cluster into macrostates of the same cell type with different microstates. Each of these microstates have different probabilities of transitioning to the next state. Once a decision is made the cells express the genes associated with the final state. This transition state is dynamic and can be influenced by both cell intrinsic factors as well as external factors like cell-cell signalling and the transition may be discontinuous.\nThis discontinuity in some of these transition states represent the step before a state jump rather than cells along a transition continuum. While cellular trajectories do exist, some of them may be discontinuous and the heterogeneity seen in the macrostates represents the array of cells before they commit to a state. Such systems evolve as a function of parameters like extracellular signalling rather than as a function of time. Depending on the parameters, the stability of the transition state can change and push cells into another state. ES cells are an example of cells where the parameters stabilise the transition state to keep them in an pluripotent state."

PMID: 26430159; PMCID: PMC4579334.\n\nGenome Research\n\nProblems with bulk methods\nBulk methods lose important detail because of averaging that results in the potential for losing interpretability or making wrong conclusions from the data. In Simpson’s Paradox a group of cells may show a certain gene expression pattern or correlation. However that pattern can be lost or reversed when they are grouped by their cell type. Averaging also loses information about cell counts and can lead to spurious patterns in the data since it does not account for cell death or divisions. Time series experiments, when averaged, would only show a mixture of cells rather than a better representation of the expression changes as the cells differentiate over time.\n\n\nTechnological advances in cellular state measurement\nMost assays require more cell material than is available from a single cell. This problem has been overcome through advances in amplification methods, modifications to reverse transcriptase and instrument development to capture individual cells.\nData analysis in single-cell experiments are significantly more challenging than bulk experiments since it can be highly variable and hard to distinguish between technical and biological variation. Some of these problems can be solved by normalization techniques like spike-ins or molecular barcoding. Further, since the data is orders of magnitude larger, algorithms need to be particularly efficient with dealing with that data.\n\n\nA dynamical systems view of the cell\nDynamical systems are used to predict complex behaviour and can be used as a model for cell states and trajectories. As a cell develops and regulates gene expression, its trajectory shape is a function of its starting position and the differential equations that dictate changes in its future expression levels given its current state.\nDistinct cell types can be described as attractors of the system that is a location that a cell will move toward or return to if disturbed - trajectories flow towards attractors. These can be used to describe a cell’s landscape with cell fates and paths between them.\n\n\nSingle-cell clustering and trajectory analysis\nTranscriptomic studies show that cells are part of that dynamical landscape and can be anywhere in it, and are not always in distinct and defined states. Attractors of such a landscape can be identified through clustering methods like PCA. These dimensionality reduction techniques can help deal with the “curse of dimensionality” In biological systems, genes can be grouped into modules with correlated expression levels allowing one gene to represent a group, further reducing dimensionality.Distances between points become increasingly similar as the dimensions of their space increase\nClustering could also be used to understand cell transition paths. Algorithms like Monocle can cluster cells not only by their type, but also by their temporal or developmental stage through pseudotime, a measure of biological progression through a cellular process. This can be done using transcriptomic data as well as with proteomic data.\n\n\nFinding genes that govern a cell state\nTo identify genes that determine where a cell is on the dynamical landscape, we need to be able to distinguish between genes differentially expressed during transitions between states and genes that are ‘always on’ or constitutively expressed.\nThis distinguishing process can be difficult because of the curse of dimensionality that makes it hard to predict gene-gene interactions and because averaging loses the source of variation needed to construct gene regulatory networks."

PMID: 31249002.\n\nDevelopment\nCells can exist in a range of phenotypes and expression profiles, within one cell type. This review introduces a framework to understand cell state and identity using cell phenotype and function, cell lineage, and cell state. This allows mapping the landscape of cell states and will allow for a better understanding of cells that leave the normal landscape and enter diseased states.\n\nPhenotype and function\nCell phenotypes like morphology are most commonly and easily used to classify cells by their morphology and activity. We can also use the transcriptome and proteome as part of the classification process since these are higher dimensional and have more features to define cell types. Single-cell transcriptomic information can provide even more information that bulk studies to help generate a rigorous and unbiased picture of cell phenotypes. Maintaining spatial information in single-cell transcriptomics can be a challenge since the process involves separating the cells, but there are new techniques that allow for in situ visualization of cellular features.\nCell function is an important determinant of cell identity. Cellular function can be investigated through genetic ablation or or the elimination of cells, but they have their limitations, especially in humans. However, it is not easy to understand the function of a new cell type without a large number of assays. In these situations, gene ontology studies can help provide an idea of the pathways that cell is involved in based on gene expression patterns. Although this can be helpful it does not provide a clear definition of cellular function. Proteins are the effectors of cellular function in cells so they could be used as predictors of cellular function.\n\n\nCell lineage\nIf measurements of cellular phenotype yield a new cell type, it is important to place the new cell type in the context of other cells. This can be achieved by understanding the cells developmental lineage which would provide clues to function. Cell lineages and fates can be tracked in a number of different ways. The tracking data can show an expected lineage or it may show that cells of different origins end up in a similar fate or that cells from similar embryonic origins end up at vastly different states.\nWe can use snRNA-seq data to make temporal reconstructions of lineage. This results are, however, inferred and would need in vitro models of human development to validate and bolster. Combining lineage data with phenotype and function data, we can produce a fairly robust picture of cell identity.\n\n\nCell state\nCell state is the “range of cellular phenotypes arising from the interaction of a defined cell type with its environment”. Cells of a certain type can change their behaviour and expression profile depending on their environment. Cell identity is generally stable while cell state is more malleable and adjusts, making just scRNA-seq data insufficient to call a cell type with confidence. Epigenetic signatures, in combination with RNA data, can provide more information about chromatic accessibility and methylation and reveal transcriptional states associated with them. Technological improvements that allow ‘multi-omic’ measurements from a single-cell will allow more robust associations between epigenetic signatures and transcriptional states. Further, lineage mapping can be applied to cells with the introduction of perturbations to track the cell’s response and its trajectory through its landscape and will allow us to better understand the paths that lead to disease states.eg: ATAC-seq, methylation data"

    "text": "Cell\nSetting up standardized definitions and classification methods for cell types is necessary for reproducible research. This review looks at cell types and states in the brain context. Current methods involve single-cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell epigenomics (ATAC-seq), connectomics where connections between neurons are studied.\nSingle-cell transcriptomics provide comprehensiveness and high dimensionality to create cell atlases. Single-cell epigenomics with single-nucleus ATAC-seq or methylation sequencing show gene and chromatin regulatory landscapes. Spatial transcriptomics provides information on the distribution of cell and their spatial relationships. The improvement of single-cell proteomics will enhance our understanding of the links between gene expression, cell structure and function, and the relationships between the transcriptome and proteome.\n\nCell types as a product of evolution\nOne approach to classify cells is phylogenetic classification which can provide a classification framework based on relatedness in a similar way to the species tree-of-life classification system. This shows the evolutionary distance between cell types and the evolution of new cell type regulatory signatures. These signatures encoded in the genome can be identified in transcriptomic data as shown by the way single-cell transcriptomic clustering reveals cell types consistent with existing knowledge. This data can also be used across species to compare cell types and their evolutionary trajectories and relationships.\n\n\nHierarchical organization of transcriptomically defined cell types\nTranscriptomic studies of the brain show a hierarchical cell type organization. Similar cell types also show differences between different brain regions. The hierarchy reflects the evolutionary cell origins and relationships. Comparisons between mouse and human cell type trees show that they are conserved across species.\nThis data also shows that there are continuous and discrete variations between cell types. The discrete differences tend to be at the top of the hierarchies and the continuous one on the lower branches. While cells on different transcriptomic profiles between ends of the tree, the variation between them is a continuum which can make it difficult to divide the cells into types and get exact type counts.\n\n\nCorrespondence between transcriptomic cell types and other cellular properties\nCell type definitions become useful when they are associated with cell function. The cell type taxonomy needs to be linked to anatomical and functional data, to evaluate the transcriptomic classification. Data on other cellular properties can be used to clean the transcriptomic data and pull out the molecular features involved in classification.\n\n\nCell types versus cell states\nOne of the main questions in classifying cell types is at what point is one cell type really just another state of another cell type? This question is particularly relevant at the lower branches of the cell type hierarchies where the differences between types become increasingly continuous. It can be difficult to delineate between types and states during development and between individual and environmental variations.\nIn the brain, non-neuronal cell types have a number of different cell states under different environmental and disease conditions. These cell types can change their function and activity and transcriptome.\nWhile single-cell transcriptomic data is usually a snapshot of a cell in time, comparing transcriptomic data measured over time could reveal how clusters and cell types move in their transcriptomic space. Generally we could assume that transcriptomic changes are more abrupt and varied in the transitions between types than between states.\n\n\nCell type development\nCell type development can involve complex trajectories and multiple differentiation steps. There are transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory programs that drive the proliferation and differentiation processes. The regulatory elements may be captured through a combination of epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic profiling with temporal resolution and lineage tracing.\n\n\nHow to define cell type\nCell types are evolutionary products and basic functional units in multicellular organisms. Their definition can start with the use of single-cell transcriptomics-based taxonomy to capture the genetic signatures driving cell-type differentiation. This information can be related to epigenetic regulatory systems and validated with anatomical and functional studies and used to determine how granular definitions should be. The definition process will also need a systematic study of the developmental process to find causal relationships and their molecular features. All this information and analysis will also need a framework like a ‘periodic table of cell types’ to hold them and standardized criteria, nomenclature, tools to enable sharing and reproducible research."

Ageing related changes in metabolism, including a loss of epigenetic resilience, may include such changes in co-factors that result in increased cell plasticity. While cancer was originally thought to be the result of genetic mutations accumulating enough to promote oncogenesis or prevent damage repair, there is now increasing evidence that there are epigenetic reasons for oncogenesis. Metabolites involved in regulating histone acetylases and deacetylases can change chromatin organization and gene-specific regulation. This paper models oncogenic chromatin aberrations caused by co-factor induced heterogeneity of epigenetic regulators. They use evidence of metabolism-driven changes in cell states as background to their work that shows how metabolic changes can lead to cell state changes without other changes to a cell’s physiology.\nThe model was an ensemble model using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Their model had a gene regulatory network (GRN) with two componets: differentiation and pluripotency with a positive feedback loop. Increase of one inhibited the other while boosting itself. Metabolite levels were noise components that affected this GRN and together, different epi-states resulted."

PMID: 28027308; PMCID: PMC5189937.\n\nSince allows there is evidence for increase in noise before a lineage choice, this study tried to quantify that noise and see if such a metric would indicate the point before a fate commitment. They work with the ESC population that can differentiate into erythroid or myeloid cell types and see the progenitor and differentiated states as stable attractor states. Their hypothesis is that differentiation requires creating instability in the progenitor state. Instability allows the cells to move out of that attractor basin into the differentiated attractor basins.\nIn the system of equations for this system\n\\[ \\dot{x}(t) = F(x(t), \\mu) \\]\n\\(\\mu\\) is the set of bifurcation parameters that are typically unknown as are the GRN specifications for cell fate decisions. So instead of trying to formulate a non-linear dynamical systems model, they use genes they know are components of the higher dimensional \\(\\boldmath{x}(t)\\). These are genes in the regulatory network of the myeloid/erythroid fates.\nThey treated the progenitor cells with either erythropoetin or GM-CSF/IL-3 to push them into the erythroid or myeloid fates. There was also a group that received both, but these had a longer delay before making a commitment and chose the myeloid fate, despite the conflicting signals.\nWith their matrix of n cells and m genes, they found a decrease in cell-cell correlation and an increase in gene-gene correlation as differentiation progressed. Based on these correlations between the cell state vectors and the genes, they developed an index of critical state transitions, \\(I_{c}\\) that is a measure of transcriptional noise. It\n\nmeasures concomitant changes in cell–cell diversity and gene–gene coordination.\n\nGene correlations increased probably because the cells go though a narrow saddle point during the move out of the progenitor attractor. Cell-cell correlation decreased since there is increased instability and more cell diversity with differentiation. The \\(I_{c}\\) increases as the cells grow in their growth factors and then drops after differentiation is complete.\n\n\\(I_{c}\\) captures the information immanent in both the m gene vectors (the expression level of a gene across a large number n of individual cells) and the n cell vectors.\n\nThey validated this in other progenitor cells and showed that the increase is at the expected time of cell fate commitment.\nm = 17 for the experiment, so they checked whether increasing that would affect the \\(I_{c}\\). If most genes considered are not relevant to the cell state changes, that would make the \\(I_{c}\\) less sensitive. However, since there are networks regulating gene expression in cells, there may only be a certain range of possible expression values and this would increase the index sensitivity. Testing this showed that when more genes are added, the test is more sensitive and better powered. When the genes are randomly chosen with a more heterogeneous cell population, sensitivity decreased with the increased noise.\nWhile the differentiation promoting factors for the two lineages pushed the progenitor population to one or the other, there were some cells in each group that committed to the opposing lineage. The authors suspect this happened because these cells were already primed to go in another direction, but when they receive a contradictory signal they have enough molecular noise to push them in their primed direction. However, they cannot survive unless they are provide with the signals that align with their fate choice. External signals and the internal stochasticity synergize to control cell fate.\nWhen they checked the cells that seemed unresponsive by their lack of change in the progenitor markers, checking them against a full transcripome and not just the 17 genes, they saw that these cells had changed. The changes were just not in the genes they were looking at, but still made them look more like the cells that did.\nThe model of selection may be an asymmetric bifurcation. One of the branches is easier to reach while the other one may be detached and needs more gene expression noise to be reached. Cell-cell signalling could promote or suppress directions in the differentiation trajectory, but this study did not examine them."

They separated the cells into three groups based on Sca-1 expression levels as Sca-1\\(^{high/mid/low}\\). All three groups were cultured separately and their Sca-1 expression levels measured over 9 days.

They extended the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model to include the transitions between the cellular subpopulations with a Gaussian mixture model made of two states.

Despise the faster commitment, the Sca-1\\(^{low}\\) cells were still undifferentiated, expressing the c-kit stem cell marker, and maintained their ability to recreate the Sca-1 expression distribution of the parental population.

To go beyond the static picture that RNA sequencing provides, distinguishing unspliced and spliced mRNAs can be used to predict a future cell state.\nmRNA introns are spliced out after transcription to form spliced mRNA which is then degraded. The change in spliced mRNA can be modelled as\n\\[ \\frac{ds}{dt} = u - \\gamma s \\]\nwhere\n\n\\(u\\) is the unspliced mRNA,\n\\(\\gamma\\) is the spliced mRNA degradation rate, and\n\\(s\\) is the spliced mRNA.\n\nThe quantity of spliced mRNA at a certain timepoint is correlated with and can be predictive of the quantity of unspliced mRNA at the next timepoint. Knowing how much unspliced mRNA there is for a gene at one point means we can predict whether that gene is actively expressed or was previously expressed and will not be expressed in the future. Coupled with information on genes that define cell states and types, we can show the trajectory a cell will take in the near future. RNA velocity allows us to understand what the origin of different cell types and states are before we have information about the developmental process .\nComputed velocities can be projected onto low dimensional embeddings of data like a PCA to visualise the trajectories between different cell states. However, since they are low dimensional, the trajectories may not be fully representative and would need examination in different dimensional combinations (eg: PC2 vs PC3)."

This depends on the ratio between spliced and unspliced mRNA and the assumption that they reach a steady-state. Velocities are determined as the deviation of the observed ratio from the steady-state ratio. This depends on the gene-level capture of the full splicing dynamics with transcriptional induction, repression and steady-state mRNA levels and on all genes sharing a common splicing rate. While RNA velocity prediction allows us to see how cells change their state, the base algorithm does not do well when the assumptions of a common splicing rate or having the full splicing dynamics are violated. Further, not all experiments are done in a time-frame that involves reaching the steady-state.\nscVelo uses a likelihood-based dynamical model rather than a steady-state model that solves the problems with those assumptions. It works by generalizing RNA velocity estimation to transient systems and systems whose subpopulation kinetics are heterogeneous. They can infer gene-specific reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation. They can also infer the underlying gene-shared latent time which represents the cell’s internal clock that describes the cell’s position in the underlying biological processes. This is different from existing pseudotime methods because it is based only on transcriptional dynamics and takes both speed and direction into account. Dynamical modelling allows for delineating cell cycling, lineage commitment, cell cycle exit and endocrine differentiation. This method, however, still assumes constant reaction rate and is limited by alternative splicing."

PMID: 34435732; PMCID: PMC8388041.\n\nRNA velocity models cellular direction and speed in transcriptome space through the ratio between spliced and unspliced mRNA and its relation to a model. Positive velocity is interpreted as upregulation while negative velocity is interpreted as downregulation. The two main approaches to RNA velocity are the steady-state model and the dynamical model. The steady-state method uses an observed steady-state between spliced and unspliced mRNA to fit a linear model and set the threshold for positive and negative velocities. This assumes that the steady-state can be observed and that the splicing rates are the same across all genes. If these assumptions are violated, however, the model is prone to errors in velocity estimates and cellular state predictions.\n\nCurrent limitations\nThe dynamical model relaxes the steady-state assumption for a more generalized model of estimation to capture heterogeneous subpopulation and cell-cycle dynamics. However, it still maintains a deterministic system of differential equations and constant kinetic rate parameters. A number of cells have multiple kinetic rates in the same gene or transcriptional boosts that are not accurately captured by the model. The model also has trouble with fully mature cell types, predicting arbitrary directions for them. Systems with complex kinetics like frequently changing kinetic rates are also not well modelled by the existing methods.\nThe statistical power of RNA velocity depends on the curvature of the phase portrait used to decide up or down-regulation. This curvature can be affected by the time variable kinetic rates of transcription, splicing and degradation. Some changes results in curvature reduction which reduces statistical power. Others result in a curve flip which changes some positive velocities to negative ones and leads to incorrect interpretations of such velocities as downregulation.\n\n\nExtensions and future directions\n\nStochastic model\nThe current RNA velocity models use simple first-order equations with constant kinetic rates, despite the fact that only a few genes can be captured with this simple system. Future extensions need to account for dynamic changes in kinetic rates to improve velocity predictions, accounting for alternative processes that modulate transcription, splicing and degradation. Identifying time variable rates will also need constraints like a pseudotime prior.\n\n\nMultivariate models towards system dynamics\nTranscriptional and post-transcriptional regulations affect dynamic changes in gene expression. The current models treat each gene independently and ignore regulatory relationships. A multivariate model can describe cell-state transitions and the regulatory interactions involved in the transitions. We can see regulatory events in a trajectory as expression changes along pseudotime. The best model would model both the RNA velocities and the regulatory network from observed expression and kinetics models. Inclusion of other modalities like chromatin modifications and RNA polymerase activity can provide significant support.\n\n\nMulti-modal omics models\nIn addition to the unspliced and spliced data we can also use other modalities like protein dynamics. In general modalities that can capture abundance, of which intronic reads are only noisy approximations, can be used to improve velocity modelling. For intronic reads, improved preprocessing may be helpful in reducing noise.\n\n\n\nTechnical challenges and extensions\nCell size normalization is currently used, but it can distort size effects. Changes in global factors like splicing efficiency or RNA polymerase abundance can affect kinetics and need to be accounted for in the model. Current models do not deal with batch effects since applying a correction to spliced and unspliced independently may reduce the information we have between them. Gene selecting can also affect the predictions since only genes that capture data variability are kept.\nIf whole cell isolation is hard to isolate, single nuclei can be used. However, they are not necessarily representative and can distort the spliced/unspliced ratio and assumptions about constant kinetics and nuclear export are not verified."

Where the original RNA velocity model had ODEs modelling the change in spliced mRNA, this model includes the change in chromatin accessibility as a third equation. This adds a third-dimension to the RNA velocity plots and gives greater confidence in predicting velocity vectors. In situations where both spliced and unspliced RNA are not present, it is difficult to predict direction. With chromatin accessibility, the model can tell whether transcription is starting or ending by whether chromatin is getting more or less accessible. Chromatin accessibility rises before gene expression changes and allows predicting directions that could not be done with gene expression data alone.\nThey describe four states that relate the epigenome and transcriptome. The first primed state is is the period where chromatin accessibility is increasing without any changes to transcription. Then transcription and chromatin accessibility increase together until chromatin accessibility starts decreasing. This is followed by lowered transcription align with continued reduction in accessibility. The points where chromatin accessibility and transcription move in the same direction are called coupled stages. When they move in opposite directions, they are considered decoupled."

This diversity can be maintained through cell-intrinsic factors like epigenetic modifications and extrinsic factors like cellular microenvironment. At each division changes can be introduced that affect the cells phenotype in a highly context-dependent way - mutations that increase proliferative potential don’t become tumors in progenitor cells.\nSingle-cell data can be used to trace cell lineage both using artificial and native lineage markers. The native markers include copy number changes, single nucleotide mutations and epigenetic patterns. With scRNA-seq we get transcriptional states and with lineage tracing we get a tree to place the states on. Neither the trees nor the transcriptional data on their own show how stable or plastic a certain state is, which is necessary to understand somatic cell evolution.\nExisting lineage tracing data that can be used to create phylogenetic trees can analysed to quantify heritability and plasticity of somatic phenotypes like a cells transcriptional state. The PATH tool from this paper can infer cell state how heritable or plastic a cell state’s phenotype is and use that measure to infer cell state transition dynamics. PATH takes phylogenetic signals and measures the correlations between phenotypes to tell whether a state is plastic or heritable.\nPATH’s “phylogenetic auto-correlation measures how much phenotypic resemblance close relatives have to one another compared to randomly chosen cells. If cells resemble close relatives much more than randomly chosen cells, the phenotype will appear highly heritable and phylogenetically auto-correlated. ..phylogenetic auto-correlation captures the temporal stability or transience of a cell state”.\nThe tools is affected by sample size and incomplete sampling can lead to overestimations of relatedness making cell states seem closer than they really are.

PMID: 35415852.\n\nLineage tracing is a tool to detect cellular parent-daughter relationships using clonal markers. Somatic cells carry a many DNA and epigenetic mutations from the zygote stage that results in patchwork of genetic makeup and can be used to delineate lineages. The general mutation rate is low enough that distant cells tend not to have similar mutations. Cells that share mutation tend to be related. Lineage tracing is necessary to study the dynamics of adult cell division and can be used to better understand cancer evolution.\n\nGermline mutations and clonal mosaicism\nEarly studies used X-inactivation to study lineage as the silencing of one X-chromosome is random and leads to a mosaic body. However the timing of markers and the rates at which they are introduced affects what we can observe and infer. X-inactivation studies are biased towards finding monoclonal cancer origin because the inactivation occurs early in development. Rare genotypes can also be used to study linage as the phenotype can be traced through these mutations and the mosaicism from X-inactivation.\n\n\nMtDNA mutations\nMitochondrial mutations occur at a higher rate than somatic mutations which makes them more prevalent in samples, but are slow enough to be unique to cells and clones making them useful for lineage tracing. In addition to the genetic data, there are also changes in protein expression that can be used to show clonal relationships.\nIn colon tissue from older people, cypts were either CCO proficient, deficient or a mixture. When a CCO- mutation occurs, there is a partial CCO- crypt which then clonally expands till the mutant allele reaches fixation leading to a fully CCO- crypt. This showed that crypts are maintained by a stem cell pool rather than an asymmetrically dividing stem cell.cytochrome C oxidase\nMtDNA is also a part of ATACseq and scATACseq allowing for sensitive detection of somatic mtDNA mutations.\n\n\nMathematical analysis of single-label lineage-tracing data\nThe branching process of clonal expansion can be modelled and the parameters that govern stem cell evolution inferred from static data. The mathematics can model the dynamical processes of evolution. They also provide a framework for experimental design and hypothesis testing and expose assumptions about the biology.\n\n\nSomatic epimutations\nAlong with genetic data, epigenetic information can also be used to conduct lineage tracing. The profiles of methylated and unmethylated CpG loci can be compared by their patterns and the Hamming distance between them. Average methylation increases with cell divisions and age, making it a biological clock. Methylation data also shows how tumor cells may epigenetically differ from normal cell in their lineage markers.\n\n\nLineage tracing with WGS\nWGS can be used to track somatic nuclear DNA mutations that uniquely mark cells. Multiregion WGS shows that normal tissue is more mutationally altered than expected and there are large clonal patches with cancer driver mutations across tissue types. WGS data can be used to measure mutation rates and timings, and advantages of driver mutations. This data can also be used to predict future evolution."

Barcoding can be technically complex and require specialized devices. They came up with the concept of ‘memory’ genes that are highly conserved across cell types and are on a high expression mean or have high variability. They were defined as genes with high variability in mean expression across cell lineages than across random samples. Analysis of the overlaps between the identified memory genes suggested that a “subset of memory gene drives overall similarity of cell lineages.” They developed GEMLI which can identify these memory genes and use them to perform hierarchical clustering for lineage inference. GEMLI is suited for time spans of a few cell divisions over the course of a few days. This lies between methods like RNA velocity which is highly dynamic and methods like lineage inference from SNPs or CNVs that require a long time.\nGEMLI works best with high sequencing depth, but does well enough between 5,000 to 8,000 reads/cell. It is also limited by datasets where only a small portion of populations get sequenced."

PMID: 31327527; PMCID: PMC6703186.\n\nCell\nGlioblastoma tumors show heterogeneity in their subtypes and the genetic alterations associated with them as well as in the developmental states of the tumor cells. This occurs through the hijacking of neural development that maintains glioblastoma stem cells in tumors. Whether different stem cell markers isolate distinct or similar cell states and whether tumor cells from different stem cell populations lead to a diverse tumor composition is not known. This paper uses scRNA-seq to characterize tumor cellular states and understand the heterogeneity in glioblastoma tumors.\nThey saw that malignant cells exist in a set of states that show neural-progenitor-like (NPC), oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like (OPC), astrocyte-like (AC), and mesenchymal-like states. The tumors contained the different types in varying proportions that were associated with CDK4, PDGFRA, EGFR, and NF1. Instead of being a steady-state of the different types, one or two would be enriched depending on these genes and environmental factors like chromosomal aberrations. The genetic drivers may drive the proliferation of particular states leading to heterogeneous tumors driven by an enriched cell state. Targeting drivers may change the state distribution and lead to another distribution driving proliferation. This model may explain why targeting single pathways is not very effective.\n\nMalignant cells intra-tumoral heterogeneity dominated by a few recurrent expression programs\nThey identified expression programs that varied between cells and then found the recurrent ones or meta-modules. 44% of signatures were associated with cell cycling. The remaining expression signatures were consistent across their tumor samples which suggests that despite differences between tumors they share fundamental processes that are reflected in their heterogeneity patterns. These signatures formed four main groups with 39-50 genes in each and recurred across the overlapping signatures from multiple tumors.\nTwo meta-modules were associated with mesenchymal-related genes that were defined as mesenchymal-like. The other four were associated with neural development characteristic of progenitor cells like OPCs and NPCs. These meta-modules mimic developmental cell types with distortions from normal expression programs.\n\n\nCycling cells and hybrid cellular states\nThey classified the tumor cells by meta-module expression and cell cycle programs. Cycling cells were between 3 and 51% and enriched in OPC-like and NPC-like states. 15% of the states expressed two modules and were defined as being in a hybrid state. This data suggests a model where tumor cells span four main cellular states and each state has proliferative potential, with NPC and OPC-like states with the highest proliferative potential.\n\n\nLimited relationship between genetic subclones and intra-tumoral state diversity\nTo see whether intra-tumoral cell state diversity reflects genetic subclones, they examined the subclones and the cell states that fell within them. All the clones had the four states in them showing that the clonal category did not reflect cellular state. The differentially expressed genes between the subclones were not associated with the meta-modules.\n\n\nDefined genetic drivers influence the distribution of cellular states\nThe frequencies of states varied between the tumors and sometime even between regions in a tumor, but the tumors had at least two states in them. There tended to be one or a combination of two states that was dominant in the tumors and that corresponded to the subtypes found earlier. The classical type had astrocyte-like enrichment while the mesenchymal-like had mesenchymal-like cell type enrichment. The proneural subtype corresponded to a combination of the OPC and NPC-like types. OPC-like and NPC-like tend to co-occur in glioblastoma and are difficult to distinguish in bulk RNA-seq.\nThey hypothesized that genetics and the tumor micro-environment are responsible for the fact that each tumor contains multiple cell types while also having one or two enriched types. This environment may be favoring or inhibiting transitions between states. They looked for differentially expressed genes between the states that are not part of that state’s expression program. For tumors with enriched AC-like cells, they found an upregulation of EGFR compared to tumors without AC-like cell type environment. EGFR acts as a regulator of astrocytic differentiation. Similarly PDGFRA was associated with the enrichment of the OPC-like cell type and CDK4 with the enrichment of the NPC-like cell-type; the OPC-like and APC-like had differential associations despite being found together in the proneural subtype.\nUsing bulk data they scored each sample for expression of the meta-module genes and from the associations between expression scores and genetic features, they saw that EGFR, PDGFRA, and CDK4 amplifications were associated with higher AC-like, OPC-like, and NPC-like scores respectively. Point mutations in NF1 were correlated with the enrichment of the mesenchymal-like cell type, but chromosomal aberrations had stronger effects on cell state enrichment.\n\n\nEGFR drives an AC-like program and CDK4 an NPC-like program in mouse neural cells\nNext they proposed that the genetic drivers they found may favor specific cell states by inducing growth or favoring transitions. They overexpressed the regulatory genes in mouse neural progenitor cells and did scRNA-seq. NPCs overexpressing EGFR induced an AC-like program and those overexpressing CDK4 induced an NPC-like program. These oncogenes favor the transition of non-cancer progenitor cells to states that they correlated with in tumors. Both EGFR and CDK4 are proliferative drivers and the mouse neural progenitor cells proliferated more with CDK4 than with EGFR while in mouse astrocytes, EGFR had a stronger proliferative effect. Cell types may respond to different oncogenes.\n\n\nDemonstration of cellular plasticity by combined scRNA-seq and cellular barcoding\nGenetics can drive the identity of cellular states, but the skew is incomplete resulting in a heterogeneity of states maintained through cellular plasticity. They tested cell ability to transition between states using xenografts and checking the state distribution in the tumor.\nThey isolated cell types by finding cell-surface markers from the meta-module genes and selected a tumor with a EGFRvIII alteration with a high AC-like proportion. After injection into the mice, they developed glioblastomas. At first they had different proportions of cell types, but over time they matched the proportions of the initial tumor sample, recapitulating the baseline distribution of states in mice.\nThey then showed plasticity by modifying a glioblastoma mouse model with H-Ras and shP53 lentiviruses. scRNA-seq of the tumors formed showed that they had three of the four cell types in them and that the barcodes added were found among cells in different states. With proliferation, heritable barcodes added to them were found in cells in different states showing common plasticity among states.\nWith human patient cell cultures and a similar procedure, they found the same barcode in different states showing that a single cell can lead to four glioblastoma states."

PMID: 26643275; PMCID: PMC4686873.\n\nThis paper describes the molecular mechanisms of renewal and differentiation of adult stem cells in the fallopian tube. Fallopian tube epithelial cells are exposed to cyclical hormonal changes and so need mechanisms to maintain their long-term renewal capacity. Their results show that stem cells are maintained by Wnt signalling and that Notch regulates stem cell genes. The work was done in an organoid model that is monoclonal and driven by an Epcam+ bi-potent stem cell population that can differentiate into secretory and ciliated cells.\nThe culture medium contained Wnt3A and RSPO1 which is critical for the formation and stem cell maintenance of the fallopian tube organoid. RSPO1 effects are mediated not by the usual effector LGR5, but by LGR6, which seems to be a homologue and could be used as a marker for fallopian tube stem cells. Without RSPO1, the organoids could not grow as well as they did when it was present to amplify Wnt3A signalling. Notch inhibition resulted in the downregulation of stemness associated genes including LGR6. This downregulation is associated with reduced proliferation and increased differentiation.\nCells from the organoid differentiated first into secretory cells and then ciliated cells, a process marked by a decrease in PAX8 towards the ciliated lineage. The loss of Pax8 is a late event in the differentiation trajectory. The stem cells themselves did not appear ciliated - cilia appeared only 2 weeks after seeding.\nThis work suggests that the enrichment of secretory cells over ciliated cells seen in high grade serous ovarian cancer could result from dysregulation of systems that reduce proliferation and self-renewal capabilities. If the mechanism that inhibits Notch signalling is dysregulated, increased Notch signalling pushes the system towards the self-renewing phenotype and away from the ciliated one."

    "text": "Dimensionality reduction\nLower dimensional representations of high dimensional biological data are useful because most of the variation in the data can be explained using just a few of the factors of the lower dimensional axes. This also reflects gene expression programs and the regulatory logic of cells. Although PCA is one of the most common and interpretable dimensionality reduction tools, the top principal components focus on the differences of highly expressed transcripts, losing information about broader expression patterns. One way to deal with this is to find the expected behaviour from all transcripts and then see if any one shows further variance above that. This would suggest that its expression pattern distinguishes major cell subpopulations.\nSince PCA works best on symmetrically distributed data (normal distributions), it is also affected by sparsity and can return technical variation as a top principal component with high sparsity. These dimensions may need to be explicitly regressed out. This correction, however, is affected by the fact that distinct subpopulations can have systematic differences in depth because of differences in the amounts of mRNA. Instead of normal distributions, count models like the negative binomial model can better approximate the spread of the data.\nNeural networks can be an easy way to map complex non-linear relationships. Autoencoders can\n\nlearn a low-dimensional representation of scRNA-seq data by finding functions that map to and from low-dimensional data in the best way that allows reconstruction of the original data\n\nAlthough non-linear methods can capture the underlying structure of the populations than linear methods, they are significantly harder to interpret.

Alternatively cells can also have non-genetic, but heritable, mechanisms of evolution that give it a selection advantage.\nThis paper uses AML as a model to study evolution since it only has one mutation that is necessary and sufficient to cause tumor formation allowing them to easily study non-genetic evolutionary forces. They individually barcoded cells to track them and transplanted them into mice. They found that AML stem cells and more mature progenitor cells were both causing disease with similar proliferation rates. The clonal differences were not a result of the cell of origin. While this demonstrated the non-genetic component, they also saw that descendants of the same barcoded cell became dominant in different mice, showing that the trait was heritable, if unstable.\nThey then examined the role of Kras and Flt3 oncogene mutations that occur in clonal populations. The dominant clones had a higher expression of Slpi, a gene for an anti-inflammatory protein and a downregulation of immune-related genes like MHC components.\nThese properties may be made heritable through DNA methylation that silences tumor suppressor genes. scATAC-seq showed reduced chromatin accessibility for B2m which is part of the MHC ssytem. There are also key transcription factors that allow the treatment resistant phenotypes to stabilize and propagate."

    "text": "Cell\n\nShackleton M, Quintana E, Fearon ER, Morrison SJ. Heterogeneity in cancer: cancer stem cells versus clonal evolution. Cell. 2009 Sep 4;138(5):822-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.017. PMID: 19737509.\n\nThe cancer stem cell model postulates that there are a few tumorigenic stem cells that give rise to the majority of the tumor cell population and these cells are the ones that can self-renew and grow the tumor. This means therapies for cancers driven by these stem cells need only target the stem cells to remove the tumor.\nThere is quite a lot of evidence for the cancer stem cell model, primarily from the fact that in certain cancers, tumorigenic cells can be distinguished from non-tumorigenic cells. This characterizes cancer stem cells: if there are two populations of tumor cells, this suggests a hierarchy in the tumor cells where some cells are able to both differentiate and self-renew. The differences between the stem cells and the differentiated cells would have to be epigenetic since it is unlikely that only some cells have the genetic ability to proliferate. This ability to distinguish between them does come with a caveat: sometimes there are non-neoplastic cells in tumors that may be seen as ‘non-tumorigenic’ or debris from the sample may be classified as a real non-tumorigenic cell.\nFurther, the epigenetic changes need to be confirmed since just the presence of both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells does not confirm a stem cell hierarchy: genetic and environmental factors can also explain that and be consistent with a clonal evolution model. At this point there was no evidence that the difference was epigenetic rather than genetic. Although CSCs may be important in some cancers, the clonal evolution process is important in all cancers.\nThe cancer stem cell model deals with the tumorigenic potential of cells, not their fate. We can use data to figure out what cell populations may lead to cancer, but whether they do depends on the individual and that would be hard to study. Therapies are driven by the consideration of tumorigenic potential since it would be dangerous to ignore any potentially tumorigenic cells. However what cells are fated to become tumorigenic is context dependent.\nDespite the evidence for cancer stem cells, there remain some problems. The evidence for CSCs from immunocompromised mice that grew tumors from transplanted human cells may underestimate the frequency of human cancer cells with tumorigenic potential. Fewer human cells are required to start a tumor in immunocompromised mice than they would in humans. Further, tumor heterogeneity after transplantation was quantified using only a few cell surface markers and not with any genetic tests. Some markers like CD133 do not distinguish between tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells in certain cancers which means markers alone are not a reliable assay for therapy efficacy. The degree to which these mouse models recapitulate the human environment is also unclear and incompatibilities between mice and human receptors and ligands may confound results.\nIt is also important to define cancer stem cells. Although conflated with tumor cells of origin which are normal cells that turn cancerous, the cancer stem cell model does not address the cell of origin. They should also not be confused with the origin of a clonal population because that is a different model for cancer."

Mol Cancer. 2014 Dec 11;13:262. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-262. PMID: 25495823; PMCID: PMC4295405.\n\nOvarian cancer shows signs of having a cancer stem cell (CSC) hierarchy where a stem cell can self-renew and differentiate into progenitor cells that go on to differentiate further into the cells that make up the tumor. The apex stem cell can stay in a quiescent state for long periods making them difficult to target with anti-mitotic agents. Despite the evidence, isolating, identifying, and growing CSCs is difficult. Ovarian cancer in particular has a serious chemoresistant recurrence problem that CSCs likely contribute significantly to.\nOne of the main ways to identify CSCs is by cell surface proteins (like CD proteins) and stemness markers (like ALDH). These markers can be used in flow cytometry to isolate the cells of interest and then assay them for their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities.\n\nIsolation\nOvarian CSCs can be isolated by their expression of ALDH1 in combination with CD markers like CD133. ALDH+/CD133+ cells are the most stem like at the top of the hierarchy. ALDH+/CD133- cells are less stem-like than the double positive cells, but more than ALDH-/CD133- cells. ALDH is, however, not required for the stemness characteristics of CSCs and its loss does not impact tumorigenicity.\nThe use of CD proteins requires prior knowledge of the cell surface expression of the protein an dare not required for CSC properties. CD133 is one of the best methods for identifying ovarian CSCs. CD24 is another marker that can be used, but has inconsistent results in classifying cells as stem-like between patient samples and cell lines. While CD44 is one of the better known markers, it cannot delineate between the different stem and progenitor cells in the hierarchy. Both CD133 and ALDH expression are linked to poor prognosis making them diagnostic markers as well.\nThe ability to form spheroids is yet another method to isolate stem cells since there is evidence that the spheroid-forming ability characterizes CSCs. Isolated putative stem cells can be validated using assays like single-cell asymmetric division.\n\n\nTargeting CSCs\nCSCs are known to be chemoresistant. Therapies aimed at CSCs need to treat with chemotherapies in addition to anti-CSC measures. Unilateral therapy methods are predicted to fail by a Clonal Cancer Stemness model. Inhibiting Notch signalling, which is necessary to maintain stemness, decreases metastasis in mouse models when combined with cisplatin. CSCs can adapt their expression profiles to form recurrent chemoresistant tumors.\nHowever, we do not know whether CSCs are inherently resistant to therapy or are able to adapt and develop resistance. One way to combat the quiescence-based resistance to chemotherapies is to force the CSCs to exit quiescence and proliferate. The creation of a stable model that can remain in a self-renewal state is necessary to identify therapeutic targets. They are currently not stable enough because the necessary culture conditions have not been identified. Spheroid conditions hold promise in maintaining the stem-like state and work on signalling will reveal the signalling factors necessary to maintain it."

The distal end of the fallopian tube is exposed to a monthly cycle of inflammatory agents and the fallopian tube is cyclically regenerating, suggesting regenerative capacity. A rare cell type has been seen in the fallopian tube, concentrated in the distal end, called an intercalary cell or a peg cell that shows neither marks of ciliated or secretory cells. This paper shows an adult stem cell population in the fallopian tube epithelium by characterizing these peg cells.\nThe constant exposure to inflammatory compounds increases the risk for damage in the fallopian tube. There is also evidence that serous cancers have their origin in the fallopian tube as tumor cells exfoliate and migrate to the ovaries. FTE stem cells do not express the best-known tumor marker for serous cancers, MUC16, which may explain why MUC16 is not found in early screening for serous cancers."

This phenotype is particularly enhanced by the gain of “oncogenic RAS or loss of p53 function”.\nWhile there were differences between the way the phenotype was expressed between different cells, there were also similarities between them indicating that there is a “conserved core secretory program that any cell undergoing senescence would trigger”. They all had “high levels of secreted inflammatory cytokines, immune modulators, and gwowth factors, suggenting that SASPs might have myriad biological activities”. They found that tumor cells were very likely to become senescent in response to DNA damage. Senescent cells create a “proinflammatory environment”.\nAlthough senescent cells tend to be removed by the immune system, they increase in number with age. This may be because aging or age-related related pathologies dampen immune response and/or increase the rate at which senescent cells are produced.\nThe authors suggest that senescence has both beneficial and detrimental effects because of antagonistic pleiotropy which may be explained as a “consequence of the declining force of natural selection with age.” Older individuals are fewer in number because of extrinsic hazards and natural selection tends to favor traits that promote “early life fitness” at the cost of longevity."

Recently, however, it has become apparent that this process entails more than a simple cessation of cell growth. In addition to suppressing tumorigenesis, cellular senescence might also promote tissue repair and fuel inflammation associated with aging and cancer progression. Thus, cellular senescence might participate in four complex biological processes (tumor suppression, tumor promotion, aging, and tissue repair), some of which have apparently opposing effects. The challenge now is to understand the senescence response well enough to harness its benefits while suppressing its drawbacks."

Neurons have low antioxidant capabilities and live for long periods which makes this oxidative stress particularly damaging and exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction. Extended exposure to oxidative stress can lead to stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS).\nAD is associated with mutations in amyloid percursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2. PS-1 is responsible for AD familial type 3 and is part of the Ɣ-secretase complex involved in APP processing to Aβ.\nCoenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant in mitochondrial membranes and facilitates the efficient transport of electrons and protects against oxidative injury.\nThis study uses PS-1 mutated AD familial type 3 fibroblasts (PSAF) and healthy skin fibroblasts to examine the therapeutic effect of water soluble coenzymeQ10. They found that the PSAF had higher ROS levels than the healthy fibroblasts as well as p53, p21 and p16Ink4a - proteins involved in cellular senescence.\nPSAF cultured with the coenzymeQ showed lower levels of senescence markers like p21 and no changes in p53 suggesting that the water soluble coenzymeQ is able to delay the onset of SIPS. It also maintained proliferation status in PSAF and reduced the levels of ROS in the PSAFs and in mitochondria isolated from them.\nIn AD, studies have reported deficits in autophagy needed for the degradation and recycling of dangerous intracellular components.

However, these markers of senescence are not universal and are not a good way to ensure that a cell is senescent.\nThis study used universally expressed transcripts from different senescent cell models and, using RNA-seq, found RNAs that could be used to identify senescent cells.\nThe main differences in RNA expression depended on the cell type of origin, and not on the senescence induction method which supports the idea that senescence is not a single phenotypic state.\nThe RNA-seq analysis revealed 50 elevated and 18 reduced transcripts between the senescent and non-senescent cells, some of which were consistent between all senescence models and were more uniform than the p21 and p16 markers.\nExamining the 68 transcripts shared between the senescent types, a PCA showed that senescence state gave the clearest separation between the cell types. An ML models using LASSO showed that 5 transcripts, SLCO2B1, CLSTN2, PTCHD4 mRNAs and LINCO2154 and PURPL lncRNAs, were the minimum needed to distinguish senescent cells. PURPL was one of the most highly and consistently elevated transcripts and is controlled by the transcription factor p53, which is elevated in senescent cells.

In WT mice senescent cells made up 10% of the examined tissue while in the preforin knockout mice, it was 43% at 24 months. The expression of p16, another senescence marker, increased more in the KO mice than the WT. This senescence increase was tested with a number of other known senescence markers and shown to be consistent.\nAlong with the increase in senescent cell numbers, there was also an increase in age-dependent chronic inflammation with increased cytokine expression and more tissue-infiltrating immune cells. In 24 month-old mice there was an increase in serum cytokine levels and pro-inflammatory factors, but not in 2 and 12 month-old mice. The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is accompanied by an increased inflammatory response.\nLoss of perforin also resulted in age-related disorders like fibrosis in various organs, loss of the subcutaneous fat layer, and loss of hair follicles. An examination of their blood for tissue damage markers found tissue damage in internal organs as well as increased urea levels, probably from kidney damage. The KO mice were less active and had poorer grip strength and coordination that the WT mice. Further, these mice also had a decreased lifespan than the WT mice.\nThey also used a mouse with the LMNA gene mutation which resulted in senescent cell accumulation. These mice, when crossed with those with the preforin deficiency, acquired the deficiency and their lifespans were shorter than the mice with just the LMNA gene mutation. This suggests that despite an increased senescent cell burden, a functioning immune surveillance system can help to slow senescence-induced ageing."

PMID: 31945125; PMCID: PMC6964973.\n\nA study showed that glioblastoma cells undergo senescence and develop the SASP which promotes tumor growth in the brain. The authors of this paper asked whether this senescence could contribute to neurodegeneration since astrocyte senescence has been observed in AD patients.\nThey used X-irradiation to induce senescence in astrocytes. Since astrocytes maintain glutamate, potassium and water homeostasis, they tested how senescence would affect the expression of genes involved in these homeostatic processes. Examining the excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2, their qPCR showed that in senescent astrocytes these genes were downregulated.\nUsing RNA-seq, they checked whether senescence affected these homeostatic pathways. Senescence markers like p16INK4a mRNA were significantly increased in the senescent astrocytes and lamin B1 was decreased according to expectations since they were both known senescence markers.\nDisease enrichment analysis on the differentially upregulated genes showed that they were involved in cancer, infectious disease or AD. The downregulated genes were involved in cancer and neurological disease. Using a dataset from NetWork Glia they filtered for Transporter associated astrocyte enriched genes. A gene-set enrichment analysis on this data gave a p-value of 0.08. This confirmed the downregulation of the amino acid transporters in senescent astrocytes.\nTheir next question was whether this downregulation affected glutamate uptake in astrocytes. Using a co-culture of neurons with senescent and non-senescent astrocytes, both with and without a 10mM solution of glutamate, they found that neurons died when cultured with glutamate and were in co-culture with senescent astrocytes. The senescent astrocytes did not take up glutamate efficiently leading to the death of co-cultured neurons.\nAstrocytes are important to neuron survival and this capability is compromised when they become senescent. If astrocytes are unable maintain an appropriate level of glutamate in the brain, neurons are at risk of death from excitotoxicity. The RNA-seq also found that APOE is upregulated in senescent astrocytes which could put AD patients at greater risk of losing neurons to glutamate toxicity."

It is a pleiotropic phenomenon vital to embryogenesis, tumour suppression, and wound healing.\nThe persistence of senescence cells without clearance by the immune system can lead to a chronic state of senescence and inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype - a state that can spread senescence to neighbouring healthy cells.\nIt can be hard to determine what cellular senescence is since there is no one marker to identify it. β-galactosidase activity and p16 expression are usually used to identify senescent cells, but these markers are not unique or always found in senescent cells.

OPCs are responsible for the myelination of neurons in the brain when they differentiate into oligodendrocytes in response to microglial signalling. Senescent microglia show dysfunctional degradation which inhibits OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. OPC senescence is associated with ageing and exposure to amyloid-beta oligomers, with expression of p16, p21 and senescence-associated beta galactosidase. Some SASP components secreted by senescent cells could interfere with myelination. Senescence also affects other cells like astrocytes, microglia and neurons. Treating senescent astrocytes with rapamycin restored astrocyte ability to support OPC differentiation. Senescence in the BBB increases its permeability and the entry of fibrinogen can interfere with the differentiation of OPCs and affect remyelination. Treatments with senolytics reduced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits which shows that senescence could contribute to the state of neuroinflammation and to the loss of cognitive function.\nMyelin is negatively related to age and loss of myelin could contribute to AD pathology. A number of cell types have been shown to become senescent on exposure to amyloid or tau in AD brains and other papers have shown that myelin disruption is found in AD and could be an early feature. TREM2 which is an AD associated gene is involved in myelin debris removal. When the myelin debris overwhelms microglia, they can become senescent and myelination an be affected."

However, the SASP can also promote tumorigenic processes like angiogenesis and invasion. During ageing the SASP can lead to chronic inflammation and spread of senescence into neighboring cells. lncRNAs could be important in regulating SASP genes. MIR310HG knock-down in BRAF-induced senescent fibroblasts reduced expression and secretion of SASP components.\nThey found that MIR310HG depletion during oncogene induced senescence affected the SASP as they did not upregulate the main components of the SASP. These cells without the MIR310HG produced less IL6 and CXCL1, SASP inflammatory factors.\nTheir examination of the paracrine effects of MIR310HG showed that the knock-down did not affect the senescence but did affect the induction of paracrine invasion. The depletion also resulted in reduced CEBPB and NF-κB activation in oncogene-induced senescence as well as decreased IL1A translation.\nSenescence-targeting therapies try to affect the SASP without changing the tumor-suppressive benefits of senescence and MIR310HG is able to reduce senescence invasion without affecting the growth arrest.

Senolytics can be used to target senescence, but more work need to be done to understand what cells to target therapeutically.\nImmunosenescence is the decline in immune function with ageing and the development of senescence that increase disease susceptibility and contribute to mortality.\nERCC1 is involved in the repair of DNA damage and reducing its expression can lead to the accumulation of oxidative lesions and senescent cells that then cause age-associated pathologies. This study used mice with ERCC1 removed from lymphoid organs that showed an accelerated ageing phenotype.\n\nImmune system changes\nThe fraction of T cells was reduced in these mice at 4-5 months and T cells and B cells were reduced in older mutant mice unlike WT mice. Natural killer cytotoxicity was impaired in the mutant mice showing unhealthy immune ageing. Overall the ERCC1 deletion caused accelerated ageing in the mice immune system and shows that the immune system is vulnerable to DNA damage.\np16 and p21 were significantly reduced in B and T cells, natural killer cells and in macrophages along with an increase in SASP expression. p16 was found in the liver, kidneys, and the lungs. SA-β-galactosidase was increased in renal tubules and the liver.\nThe mutant mice were poorer muscle regeneration after injury as well as reduced grip strength.

The mutant splenocytes had increased levels of luciferase signal than those from controls. SASP protein levels were also increased in the recipients of mutant splenocytes. These results show that senescent immune cells can drive ageing and affect lifespan.\n\n\nCell autonomous mechanism\nThen they also transplanted splenocytes from young WT mice into the mutant mice. This resulted in the mutant mice showing reduced senescence and SASP factors levels. This also reduced p16 and p21 mRNA in mutant mice supporting the idea that a loss-of-function mechanism is involved in the inability of aged immune cells to suppress senescence.\n\n\nRapamycin rejuvenation\nRapamycin is used in elderly people to improve their immune response to flu vaccination. The mutant mice were treated with rapamycin and their immune response was improved and p16 and p21 expression was reduced suggesting a modulation of the gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms through which senescence drives ageing.\nThe study concluded that immune cells are vulnerable to endogenous DNA damage that can cause cell death or senescence if left unrepaired. Immunosenescence affects innate and adaptive immunity and drives senescence and age-related changes in solid organs."

PMID: 16934480.\n\nAxonal lesions are a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, MS, and Alzheimer’s disease. The response to these lesions is the axon reaction and includes metabolic and structural changes in the lesioned nerve cells and an activation of surrounding glial cells. This innate immune response can have beneficial and harmful effects.\nThey removed the ventral root in two strains of adult rats and found that the ensuing neurodegeneration had the activation of astrocytes and microglia and upregulation of immunological compounds. The DA strain represents an injury susceptible model and the PVG represents an injury resistant one. Their DA strain had more glial activation and greater lesioned motorneuron loss compared to the PVG strain. This differences between the strains could show the importance of susceptibility to inflammatory disease in humans.\nThe largest group of upregulated genes were part of an immunological and inflammatory gene group and these were more expressed in the strain susceptible to neurodegeneration."

PMID: 33671362; PMCID: PMC7922097.\n\nWhile the risks for both neurodegeneration and cancer increase with age, there is an inverse correlation between the odds of getting one or the other. A number of genes, proteins, and pathways are shared, but in opposite directions. A recent study found that the most shared risk SNPs were in the locus containing the lncRNA ANRIL that modulates cell cycle regulators like CDKN2A-B that codes for p16INK4A, a mediator of cellular senescence. Senescence may contribute towards the inverse correlation between the risks for cancer and neurodegeneration. Senescent cells could be a way to avoid cancer development, but may contribute to neurodegeneration with age.\nFor the review of the evidence of senescence in these diseases, they used cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, the SASP, and SA-β-gal as senescence markers.\nThey found some evidence to suggest that senescence protects against cancer, but they did not find enough to come to a strong conclusion. One study found that in pilocytic asrocytoma, a tumor formed from astrocytes, the presence of p16 and SA-β-gal were associated with increased patient survival. Exposure to genetic and external carcinogenic stimuli resulted in senescence markers being expressed in brain cells.\nHowever, most of the papers they read did not fully characterize senescence, using only a few markers which meant that there may have been other explanations for their results that don’t include senescence. Some markers used, like p21, are part of normal cell functioning and by themselves do not necessarily indicate senescence.\nTheir conclusion was that additional work needed to be done in the area that better identified senescence."

Epub 2020 Nov 30. PMID: 33257875.\n\nThis paper explores the role of the immune system in the brain with regards to inflammation. They found that natural killer cells played important roles in the immune surveillance of the aged brain and outnumber other immune cell types. NK cell surveillance is triggered when brain cells become senescent. NK cells play a key role in the decline of neurogenesis and cognition during normal brain ageing.\nNK cells were found to preferentially accumulate in the dentate gyrus, but not in adjacent areas. They hypothesized that there were focal factors that bridged the interactions between NK cells and dentate gyrus cells. This was confirmed by the increased presence of Ki67-expressing NK cells and higher proliferative activity of transplanted NK cells in aged dentate gyrus compared to young. Overall, normal brain ageing induces an environment that facilitates NK cell accumulation.\nCellular senescence is known to trigger Nk cell surveillance and they found NK cells close to SASP expressing neuroblasts. These cells reinforce NK cell functions and surveillance resulting in the elimination of aged neuroblasts. Restriction of NK cell activity could help facilitate neurogeneration and ameliorate neurogenerative conditions as NK cell depletion mitigated the decline in synaptic plasiticity and cognitive function."

It the brains with pathologies, they found a strong association of ferritin light chain which is responsible for storing intracellular iron with dystrophic microglia.\nThere was no clear pattern of increased microglial dystrophy with age in the hippocampus or white matter, but there was an increase in the proportion of dystrophic microglia in the frontal cortex.

The high pathology controls also had significantly higher brain weights than those with AD.\nInflammation was measured as C5b-9 immunoreactivity and was found abundantly in AD samples. The HPC inflamamtion levels on the other hand were more comparable to those of normal controls. This immunoreactivity was the most sensitive correlate of synapse loss.

PMID: 26871627.\n\nThe linearity of the cascade remains very controversial. For instance, exploration of the direct link between Aβ and neurotoxicity has resulted in a rather confusing literature with at least ten different molecular mechanisms and receptors (see Figure 1) (Benilova et al., 2012). It is debatable whether they all equally contribute to the disease process in humans, as many of the supporting studies used non-physiologically high concentrations of Aβ or transgenic mice significantly overexpressing APP Thus, the neuron-centric view has to be expanded to one that considers the contribution of different cell types, their interactions with each other, and the gradual evolution of the disease.\nInstead of Aβ and Tau, the real causes of sporadic disease are upstream of these proteopathies and are likely manifold, with aging being the major driver.\nThis paper examines the amyloid cascade hypothesis and questions the linearity of the amyloid cascade in producing AD pathology, saying the biochemistry of the brain needs to be intergrated. They found that studies supporting the amyloid cascade hypothesis used non-physiologically high concentrations of Aβ or transgenic mice overexpressing APP. Since a lot of ‘confusing’ literature with many different molecular mechanisms have come out they are skeptical that all equally contribute to AD pathology. They also suggested that instead of Aβ and tau, the real causes of sporadic disease may be upstream of those proteopathies, with aging being the major driver of these conditions.\nIn general, they believe that the neuron-centric view needs to be expanded to consider the contribution of different cell types and interactions including astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and the role of the neurovascular unit and the vascular hypothesis of AD. With single-cell sequencing, more of these mechanisms and pathways can be explored.\nThey also suggested that instead of Aβ and tau, the real causes of sporadic disease may be upstream of those proteopathies, with aging being the major driver of these conditions."

Compared to this, the bulk analysis was only able to capture the expression from the single-cell level in exitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes, not the other cell types. Bulk sequencing could also not capture when the differentially-expressed genes had opposite directionality.\nThe authors used an unsupervised learning framework called self-organizing maps to find the gene sets with similar expression patterns that also correlated with the AD phenotype. They found that in exitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, each cell type had a distinct SOM unit which meant that different gene groups respond to AD pathology.\nExamining the pathology between sexes, they found differences in AD-associated cell subpopulations, transcriptional activations, and responses to amyloid."

Cell Death Dis. 2021 Feb 4;12(2):151. doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-03438-9. PMID: 33542214; PMCID: PMC7862496.\n\nThis study investigated the effects of an isoform of p53 on the zebrafish brain ageing, learning and memory.\nThe zebrafish Δ133p53 isoform is an ortholog of the same human isoform and is highly induced in response to low ROS levels and promotes cell survival and inhibits senescence. It is found in the telencephalon ventricular zone. Zebrafish with a mutant variant of this isoform have higher levels of ROS and show accelerated ageing. Decreased expression of human Δ113p53 is associated with replicative senescence and has been observed in the brains of patients with AD and ALS. Examining a variant of this isoform and its role in brain ageing they found that the expression of antioxidant genes significantly decreased in mutant telencephalons compared to wild type. There were increased levels of hydrogen peroxide as well as an increase in the level of SA-β-gal activity, an indicator of cellular senescence.\nThey also ran a test to see how memory and learning would be affected by the mutation. Using a swim tank, with one half colored red and the other colored white, they shocked the fish when they were in the white area. The wild type fish spent less time in the area coloured white compared to the mutant fish. Although these differences were found between the two groups, they did not find any significant differences between the DNA damage response or apoptotic activity.\nInterestingly, they also note that SIRT1, a senescence-related gene plays a protective role in neurodegenerative disease and that it was downregulated in the mutant group. This downregulation along with the increased levels of ROS could lead to increased brain ageing.\nThis paper showed how a mutation in the p53 isomer resulted in an increased risk for developing senescence and also resulted in cognitive problems. This suggests that there could be a link between an increased risk of senescence and developing cognitive problems."

PMID: 32760251; PMCID: PMC7373805.\n\nTelomere attrition is found in a number of disorders and studies have tried to understand the relationship between TL length and these disorders. This paper reviews the literature concerning TL, AD, and PD. Telomere length is maintained by telomerase and, while its activity in the brain decreases after birth, there is high activity in neuronal stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells. There are only inconsistent results between cognitive performance and TL.\nResults in AD studies have been contradictory. Telomere shortening and reduced telomerase activity was found in rat microglial cells, but in aged telomerase knockout mice had decreased progression of amyloid plaque pathology. The authors think small study cohorts may be responsible for the inconsistencies since a meta-analysis showed more consistent evidence for shorter telomeres in AD.\nThey concluded that telomere length is a questionable biomarker for clinical use because it has low specificity and sensitivity. It could still be important because it is unclear whether telomere length is a cause or consequence of age-related disorders, but should be understood in the context of other markers.\nIt was interesing because I expected telomeres to be reliable biomarkers since they are a major part of cellular senescence. However, with better methods and the longitudinal studies that the authors recommend, there may be important relationships to be discovered that could contribute to the explanation of AD pathogenesis and the role of senescence."

Using a mouse with a dominant-negative (RbAp48-DN) form of RbAp48 without the ability to interact with histone H4, they inhibited RbAp48 function in the adult forebrain.\n\n\nEffect of forebrain-specific inhibition of RbAp48 on memory in young mice\nThey examined all their mice in open field tests and both the inhibited and functional RbAp48 has similar results which meant that their anxiety levels were not affected by the inhibition.\nIn a novel objection recognition test, both mice showed similar behaviour initially, but after 48 hours however, the inhibited mice did not show a preference for a novel object like the control mice did.When the expression of the double-negative form of the protein was inhibited, both groups of mice performed similarly in the novel object recognition test. The inhibition of RbAp48 resulted in poorer novel object recognition performance.\nIn the Morris water maze, after one day of learning, the transgenic mice showed impaired memory, but no noncognitive differences.\n\n\nMemory deficits in the transgenic and aged mice\nAged mice showed memory deficits similar to the young transgenic mice and had similar performances as the young mice in learning tasks. The inhibition of RbAp48 in the forebrain leads to the cognitive defects characteristic of hippocampal ageing.\n\n\nEffects of the dominant-negative in the DG\nCompared to control mice, the transgenic mice showed selective dysfunction in the DG which was reversed when the dominant-negative gene was turned off.\n\n\nEffect of RbAp48-DN on histone acetylation in the DG\nExamination of the acetylation of H4 and H2B showed that RbAp48 inhibition caused a reduction in acetylation. This was also reversible when RbAp48-DN expression was turned off.\n\n\nEffect of upregulating RbAp48 in aged mice\nIncreasing RbAp48 in the DG improved memory performance in the novel object recognition test and the water test.\n\n\nEffect of RbAp48-DN expression in the forebrain on HAT activity of CBP\nThe CBP HAT activity was lower in the DG of the transgenic mice, but the amount of CBP protein was the same. A selective reduction of CBP HAT activity in the DG was found in aged WT mice."

RbAp48 interaction with CREB1-dependent CBP and HAT regulation, which is important for memory storage. There was a DG-specific reduction of HAT activity in the transgenic young and aged mice. These effects were reversed in by increasing RbAp48 abundance.\nThese results show that RbAp48 in the DG is necessary for hippocampal functioning. They also suggest that age-related memory loss is independent of AD and since other studies have not implicated RbAp48, these results show that they have distinct mechanisms.\nSince RbAp48 works through the PKA-CREB1-CBP pathway which is important to age-related memory loss in mice, it could be a potential therapeutic avenue. Enhancing he CREB1 pathway reduces age-related hippocampal dysfunction in rodents and could have benefits for humans."

They identified significantly altered genes in the gene ontology pools associated with these psychiatric disorders to see whether these symptoms in AD could be associated with them.\nThey found that the BIP, SCZ, and MDD related were significantly changed in the AD animal model. The number of SCZ associated genes were higher than those of BIP and MDD and SCZ was the most associated with AD and these genes are thought to be involved in synaptic dysfunction in AD mice.

The intensity of accumulation depends on the subtype of AD and can be used to distinguish between sporadic and familial AD. The forms of iron in AD patients vary in the torque they experience in a magnetic field compared to controls.\nIron is associated with the pathological lesions in AD and it could be that it promotes the aggregation and oligomerization of Aβ peptides. Iron and the iron storage protein ferritin levels are associated with amyloid deposition amount.\nIron could enhance the translation and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein by its aberrant binding to APP mRNA. Iron is also involved in tau phosphorylation and aggregation - events mitigated by iron chelation. NFT tau accumulation is associated with the induction of heme oxygenase-1 which releases iron from heme exacerbating oxidative stress.\nIron is associated with the rate of cognitive decline 12 years before death.
