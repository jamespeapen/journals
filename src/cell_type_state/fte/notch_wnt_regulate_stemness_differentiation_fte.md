This paper describes the molecular mechanisms of renewal and differentiation of
adult stem cells in the fallopian tube. Fallopian tube epithelial cells are
exposed to cyclical hormonal changes and so need mechanisms to maintain their
long-term renewal capacity. Their results show that stem cells are maintained by
Wnt signalling and that Notch regulates stem cell genes. The work was done in an
organoid model that is monoclonal and driven by an Epcam+ bi-potent stem cell
population that can differentiate into secretory and ciliated cells.

The culture medium contained Wnt3A and RSPO1 which is critical for the formation
and stem cell maintenance of the fallopian tube organoid. RSPO1 effects are
mediated not by the usual effector LGR5, but by LGR6, which seems to be a
homologue and could be used as a marker for fallopian tube stem cells. Without
RSPO1, the organoids could not grow as well as they did when it was present to
amplify Wnt3A signalling. Notch inhibition resulted in the downregulation of
stemness associated genes including *LGR6*. This downregulation is associated
with reduced proliferation and increased differentiation.

Cells from the organoid differentiated first into secretory cells and then
ciliated cells, a process marked by a decrease in PAX8 towards the ciliated
lineage. The loss of Pax8 is a late event in the differentiation trajectory. The
stem cells themselves did not appear ciliated - cilia appeared only 2 weeks
after seeding.

This work suggests that the enrichment of secretory cells over ciliated cells
seen in high grade serous ovarian cancer could result from dysregulation of
systems that reduce proliferation and self-renewal capabilities. If the
mechanism that inhibits Notch signalling is dysregulated, increased Notch
signalling pushes the system towards the self-renewing phenotype and away from
the ciliated one.
