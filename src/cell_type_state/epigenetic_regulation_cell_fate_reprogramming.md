Ageing is associated with changes to the epigenome and a greater incidence of
cancer. Ageing related changes in metabolism, including a loss of epigenetic
resilience, may include such changes in co-factors that result in increased cell
plasticity. While cancer was originally thought to be the result of genetic
mutations accumulating enough to promote oncogenesis or prevent damage repair,
there is now increasing evidence that there are epigenetic reasons for
oncogenesis. Metabolites involved in regulating histone acetylases and
deacetylases can change chromatin organization and gene-specific regulation.
This paper models oncogenic chromatin aberrations caused by co-factor induced
heterogeneity of epigenetic regulators. They use evidence of metabolism-driven
changes in cell states as background to their work that shows how metabolic
changes can lead to cell state changes without other changes to a cell's
physiology.

The model was an ensemble model using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Their
model had a gene regulatory network (GRN) with two componets: differentiation
and pluripotency with a positive feedback loop. Increase of one inhibited the
other while boosting itself. Metabolite levels were noise components that
affected this GRN and together, different epi-states resulted.
