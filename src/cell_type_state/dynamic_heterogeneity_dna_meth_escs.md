Cell population heterogeneity occurs naturally since transcription is a
stochastic process. However, the heterogeneity within a population of identity
could also include the existence of sub-identities or states. As cells
differentiate this heterogeneity also needs to be stabilized for stable cell
identities to exist. DNA methylation is one way to stabilize a cell's state in a
heritable way. This paper investigates the role of DNA methylation in reversible
state transitions rather than irreversible ones. There was already evidence that
inhibiting MEK and GSK3$\beta$ (2i) removes heterogeneity and a pluripotent state
with reduced DNA methylation.

### How noise and states determine expression level distributions of regulatory genes?

An analysis of gene expression distributions in mouse embryonic stem cells
(mESCs) showed three major groups within a bursty transcriptional dynamics
framework that produces negative binomial distributions. They found that gene
expression is noisy and occurs in stochastic bursts. The first group were
well fit by a single negative binomial distributions. The second had long tail
distributions where most cells had few to no transcripts, but a few cells had
many transcripts. This was also well fit by the negative binomial distribution.
However, a third group had distributions better fit by a liner combination of
two negative binomial distributions than one. These bimodal distributions
suggested that there were multiple cell states in that population separated by
these transcripts.

### How do gene expression and methylation levels vary in cells within a state and during state transitions?

The bimodal genes varied coherently suggesting that there were two distinct cell
states. The genes with the long tailed distributions were found in one of these
two states. DNA methylation at known methylation targets increased with a
reduction in pluripotency as cells went from *Rex1*-high to *Rex1*-low. There
was differential methylation at some genes and *Rex1*-low cells that reverted to
the *Rex1*-high state recovered methylation at loci where *Rex1*-high cells had
more methylation. The change in methylation occurred at a subset of promoters
and was related to the number of CpGs in the promoter. Higher CpG content had
lower methylation in both states. Multiple ESC regulators had increased
methylation in the *Rex1*-low state.

They also found that bursty transcription generates dynamic fluctuations in
individual cells. These changes look bursty on short timescales and like
stochastic interstate switching events on longer timescales. State transitions
occurred stochastically and affected the expression of many genes coherently.

### Cells stabilize metastable expression states with DNA methylation

Although there was differential methylation between the two *Rex1* states, it
was not clear whether methylation played a role in stabilizing the states. In
cells without DNA methyltransferases to methylate, there were fewer cells in the
*Rex1*-low state. Without DNA methylation, cells were unable to move forward
towards a more differentiated state. Exposed to the DNA methylation inhibitor
5-azacytidine, the number of *Rex1*-low cells decreased. Cells treated with 2i
also had a reduction in the *Rex1*-low population. When 2i was removed
from cells treated with it, the *Rex1*-low population began to come back.
However, when 2i is replaced with 5-azacytidine, the *Rex1*-low population
recovery was diminished. This showed that reduced methylation in 2i contributed
to the stability of the 2i group state and is required for transitions.
