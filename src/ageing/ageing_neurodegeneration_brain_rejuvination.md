# Ageing, neurodegeneration and brain rejuvenation

November 9, 2016

AD and other neurodegenerative conditions are increasing in prevalence and tend
to be found among older people. Since many changes that occur during normal
ageing also occur during neurodegeneration, are these changes important to the
neurodegenerative process?

Aged brains without AD pathology report Aβ plaques, NFTs and other hallmarks of
neurodegeneration which suggests that there are problems in proteostasis. One
hypothesis suggests that in normal ageing, macromolecules become oxidized and
cannot be degraded by lysosomes which leads to increased lysosome production.
This is evidenced by the deposition of lipofusin as a result of lysosomal
inefficiency.

Studies of nonagenerians and centenarians found that almost half their sample
size met the AD pathology criteria. Around 30% of individuals without cognitive
impairment are positive for markers of disease.

## Causes of brain ageing and neurodegeneration

While it is tempting to see neurodegeneration as accelerated ageing, this view
does not capture the underlying mechanisms that connect neurodegeneration and
ageing - all age-related disease may be seen as accelerated ageing.
Understanding how environmental factors and genes intersect in disease and the
processes involved in these interactions.

Studies on longevity show that healthy ageing is associated with the absence of
AD and cardiovascular disease risk factors. People 80 and older unaffected by
chronic disease also showed links between health and SNPs associated with
cognitive performance suggesting that brain health and cognition may play a role
in healthy ageing.  DNA methylation in neurodegenerative disease shows
accelerated ageing. Transcriptome and epigenome analyses show a downregulation
of synaptic plasticity genes and increased expression of immune response genes.

## The circulatory proteome of organismal ageing

Intercellular communication could help in the understanding of the ageing
process and the identification of ageing biomarkers. The communication between
cells changes with age and some of these changes may contribute to ageing.

There are studies describing the blood changes that they believe reflect changes
occurring in the brain. These have found a number of genes and signalling
pathways related to AD that could be biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

Inn a study with young and old mice, they found that there was a chemokine *CCL11*
that correlated with ageing. When administered into young mice, they showed
reduced neurogenesis and cognitive impairment. The levels of *CCL11* increases in
the choroid plexus during ageing and in fat deposits with obesity, decreasing
with exercise. These studies show that communication proteins in the blood are
linked with and can modulate brain ageing.

## Abnormal intercellular communication and inflammation

Immune factors and chemokines are linked to the negative effects of neurogenesis
in the study with the mice. These are part of a low-grade inflammation
associated with ageing. The inflammatory factors could come from senescent
astrocytes and microglia that develop the SASP.

Many SNPs in the chemokine cluster containing *CCL11* were linked to a 10-year
difference in the age of clinical AD onset  were linked to a 10-year difference
in the age of clinical AD onset.
