VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is an angiogenic factor that promotes
the development and repair of blood vessels. It is hypoxically induced and acts
to match tissue needs. The reason for its age-related depletion is unknown.

This paper increased the levels of VEGF in mice and found that there was an
amelioration of age-related disorders including inflammaging, sarcopenia and
osteoporosis. In mice with reduced levels of VEGF they found an accelerated
development of these age-related disorders.
