Cellular senescence serves an important tumour supressive role and prevents
stressed cells from turning oncogenic and proliferating.

However, long-term or chronic senescence has deleterious effects. Their
cell-autonomous proliferative arrest is maintained by p53 and CDK4 and CDK6
inhibitor p16. p53 upregulates p21 to arrest the cell cycle. p16 is activated by
stress-related pathways like the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Since senescence cells
resist death and can persist, they may accumulate and exhaust tissues of
proliferation-competent cells and renewable stem cells, overall reducing the
its regenerative capacity. The SASP can also promote DNA damage response and
proliferative arrest and promote senescence in neighbouring cells.

## Epigenetic changes during senescence and ageing

Senescence-associated heterochromatic foci form during cellular senescence and
are enriched in markers that repress proliferation-related genes. SAHF may not
always be found in senescent cells. The heterochromatin in the SAHF is formed
through heterochromatin redistribution from its loss from nuclear periphery,
which is mediated by a loss of lamin B1. Lamin B1 is downregulated in senescence
and silencing it can induce senescence.

## Epigenetic effectors of cellular senescence

High Mobility Group proteins HMGA1 and HMGA2 accumulate in the chromatin of
senescent cells, displacing linker histone H1, and structurally support the
SAHF. HMGB1 has p53-dependent secretion and activates NFÎºB and pro-inflammatory
pathways. HMGA2 also has pro-inflammatory roles, different from HMGB1, one of
which is binding the loci of SASP genes to prevent them from being incorporated
into SAHF regions that repress transcription - the SASP could be separated from
the more beneficial senescent cell cycle arrests.

## Epigenetic regulators of the SASP

Inhibition of the SASP enhancer BRD4 suppressed the SASP while maintaining the
arrest of senescent cells. SASP is negatively regulated by SIRT1. With SIRT1
knockdown or reduced expression in senescence, acetylation of H3K9 and H4K16 is
increased at interleukin 6 and 8 promoters and their increased transcription.
