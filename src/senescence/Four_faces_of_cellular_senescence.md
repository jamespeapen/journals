## Abstract

Cellular senescence is an important mechanism for preventing the proliferation
of potential cancer cells. Recently, however, it has become apparent that this
process entails more than a simple cessation of cell growth. In addition to
suppressing tumorigenesis, cellular senescence might also promote tissue repair
and fuel inflammation associated with aging and cancer progression. Thus,
cellular senescence might participate in four complex biological processes
(tumor suppression, tumor promotion, aging, and tissue repair), some of which
have apparently opposing effects. The challenge now is to understand the
senescence response well enough to harness its benefits while suppressing its
drawbacks.
