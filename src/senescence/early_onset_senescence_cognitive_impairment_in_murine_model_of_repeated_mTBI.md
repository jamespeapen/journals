Mild traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases.
There is an increase in oxidative stress that can lead to DNA damage that
overwhelms the cells damage response mechanisms. Brain cells may start to become
senescent with repeated activation of the DDR pathway. This paper uses a mouse
model with repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) to examine the role of
senescence in mTBI related neurodegeneration.

The injured mice showed a poorer righting reflex than the control mice as well
as spatial and memory impairment. The examination of their brains revealed that
they had gliosis, mircogliosis and axonal damage. rnaSeq showed that 24 hours
after the injuries, the DDR was activated and cell-cycle arrest induced. Seven
days after the injuries, more genes were found to be significantly different
between the two mice groups. There was an increase in cellular
senescence-related genes  as well as genes known to be risk factors and
biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Several of these genes are associated
with AD-like pathology which shows that neurodegenerative processes may begin as
soon as a week after the injury.  Further, there was a decrease in DDR gene
expression which would put the brain at greater risk of damage if there were
repeated incidences of TBI.
