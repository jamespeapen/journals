A study showed that glioblastoma cells undergo senescence and develop the SASP
which promotes tumor growth in the brain. The authors of this paper asked
whether this senescence could contribute to neurodegeneration since astrocyte
senescence has been observed in AD patients.

They used X-irradiation to induce senescence in astrocytes. Since astrocytes
maintain glutamate, potassium and water homeostasis, they tested how senescence
would affect the expression of genes involved in these homeostatic processes.
Examining the excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2, their qPCR showed that
in senescent astrocytes these genes were downregulated.

Using RNA-seq, they checked whether senescence affected these homeostatic
pathways. Senescence markers like p16INK4a mRNA were significantly increased in
the senescent astrocytes and lamin B1 was decreased according to expectations
since they were both known senescence markers.

Disease enrichment analysis on the differentially upregulated genes showed that
they were involved in cancer, infectious disease or AD. The downregulated genes
were involved in cancer and neurological disease. Using a dataset from NetWork
Glia they filtered for Transporter associated astrocyte enriched genes. A
gene-set enrichment analysis on this data gave a p-value of 0.08. This confirmed
the downregulation of the amino acid transporters in senescent astrocytes.

Their next question was whether this downregulation affected glutamate uptake in
astrocytes. Using a co-culture of neurons with senescent and non-senescent
astrocytes, both with and without a 10mM solution of glutamate, they found that
neurons died when cultured with glutamate and were in co-culture with senescent
astrocytes. The senescent astrocytes did not take up glutamate efficiently
leading to the death of co-cultured neurons.

Astrocytes are important to neuron survival and this capability is compromised
when they become senescent. If astrocytes are unable maintain an appropriate
level of glutamate in the brain, neurons are at risk of death from
excitotoxicity. The RNA-seq also found that APOE is upregulated in senescent
astrocytes which could put AD patients at greater risk of losing neurons to
glutamate toxicity.
