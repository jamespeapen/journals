This review examines methods to detect senescent cells since there is not one
defining trait that is unique to senescenct cells. Senescenece can happen
independently of the organisms' age and have both advantageous and deleterious
effects. They define cell cycle arrest, secretion, macromolecular damage, and
deregulated molecular profile as characteristics of cellular senescence. They
also examine ways to detect senescent cells in humans. While there are markers
that can be used, no marker is a unique or defining enough to decide whether the
cell is senescent. Even the SASP, while a common feature, is a varied one. The
authors advise a multi-pronged approach to identifying senescence.
