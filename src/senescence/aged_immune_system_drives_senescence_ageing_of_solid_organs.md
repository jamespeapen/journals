Ageing is one of the greatest risk factors for chronic diseases and ageing
processing like senescence are a treatment target. Senolytics can be used to
target senescence, but more work need to be done to understand what cells to
target therapeutically.

Immunosenescence is the decline in immune function with ageing and the
development of senescence that increase disease susceptibility and contribute to
mortality.

*ERCC1* is involved in the repair of DNA damage and reducing its expression can
lead to the accumulation of oxidative lesions and senescent cells that then
cause age-associated pathologies. This study used mice with *ERCC1* removed from
lymphoid organs that showed an accelerated ageing phenotype.

### Immune system changes

The fraction of T cells was reduced in these mice at 4-5 months and T cells and
B cells were reduced in older mutant mice unlike WT mice. Natural killer
cytotoxicity was impaired in the mutant mice showing unhealthy immune ageing.
Overall the *ERCC1* deletion caused accelerated ageing in the mice immune system
and shows that the immune system is vulnerable to DNA damage.

*p16* and *p21* were significantly reduced in B and T cells, natural killer
cells and in macrophages along with an increase in SASP expression. *p16*
was found in the liver, kidneys, and the lungs. SA-β-galactosidase was increased
in renal tubules and the liver.

The mutant mice were poorer muscle regeneration after injury as well as reduced
grip strength. They also had a shorter lifespan than the control mice showing
that an aged immune system can lead to the loss of homeostasis and damage in
peripheral organs, negatively affecting lifespan.

### Cell non-autonomous mechanism

The authors transplanted splenocytes from the mutant mice and two-year-old WT
mice into *p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>* luciferase reporter mice. The mutant splenocytes
had increased levels of luciferase signal than those from controls. SASP protein
levels were also increased in the recipients of mutant splenocytes. These
results show that senescent immune cells can drive ageing and affect lifespan.

### Cell autonomous mechanism

Then they also transplanted splenocytes from young WT mice into the mutant mice.
This resulted in the mutant mice showing reduced senescence and SASP factors
levels. This also reduced *p16* and *p21* mRNA in mutant mice supporting the
idea that a loss-of-function mechanism is involved in the inability of aged
immune cells to suppress senescence.

### Rapamycin rejuvenation

Rapamycin is used in elderly people to improve their immune response to flu
vaccination. The mutant mice were treated with rapamycin and their immune
response was improved and *p16* and *p21* expression was reduced suggesting a
modulation of the gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms through which senescence
drives ageing.

The study concluded that immune cells are vulnerable to endogenous DNA damage
that can cause cell death or senescence if left unrepaired. Immunosenescence
affects innate and adaptive immunity and drives senescence and age-related
changes in solid organs.
