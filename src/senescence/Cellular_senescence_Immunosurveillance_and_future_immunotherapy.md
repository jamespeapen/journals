## Introduction

Cellular ageing is a result of gradual accumulation of damage over time while
cellular senescence is a programmed change in cell state and a permanent
inhibition of growth. Senescent cells gain new functions, but aged cells do not.

Senescence induction is the programmed response following DNA damage response
(DDR) triggered by stressing stimuli.

One of the main phenotypes of senescent cells is the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype in which the cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines,
growth factors and proteases.

## Immune response

The DDR during the induction of senescence induces an altered secretome that
attracts and activates immune cells and upregulates the expression of NKG2D
ligands on senescent cells allowing them to be recognized by immune cells.

The reactivation of p53 in p53-deficient tumours promoted the induction of
senescence which was associated with the activation of the innate immune system
leading to tumour clearance. Clearance of senescent cells in fibrotic livers
prevented excess fibrosis.

NK mediated killing depended on granule exocytosis and mice with defects in
granule exocytosis accumulated senescent cells. There are cell receptors that
are upregulated after senescence induction to allow identification by natural
killer cells.

Senescent cells also release factors that promote macrophage polarisation
towards a tumour-inhibiting M1 state capable of targeting senescent cells.

## Immunosuppressive response

The senescence-mediated immune response can be immunosuppessive and tumour
promoting. This may be dependent on the genetic background of the cells and the
mode of senescence induction as well as whether the cells have persisted in
senescence and undergone changes associated with a chronic response rather than
a beneficial acute response. A chronic senescence response can promote
age-related inflammatory disease.

## Senescence of immune cells

The senescence of immune system cells can lead to immune suppression, elevated
inflammation, accumulation of other senescent cells and immunosenescence which
is the ageing of the immune system.

### Astrocytes

Î²-amyloid can trigger cell senescence in astrocytes which could increase the
risk of sporadic AD. Genes involved in neuronal development and differentiation
were down-regulated in senescent astrocytes.

## Immunotherapy targeting senescent cells

The removal of senescent cells could be a potential therapy for
senescence associated ageing diseases like AD. However, removing acute
senescent cells could be problematic and prevent normal functioning like wound
healing and tumor suppression.

Senolytics that use the immune system to target senescent cells may not work if
the immune system has itself undergone senescence.
