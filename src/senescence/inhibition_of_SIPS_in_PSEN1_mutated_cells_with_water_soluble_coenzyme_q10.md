In AD, one of the early events in vulnerable neurons is the increased
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Neurons have low antioxidant
capabilities and live for long periods which makes this oxidative stress
particularly damaging and exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction. Extended
exposure to oxidative stress can lead to stress-induced premature senescence
(SIPS).

AD is associated with mutations in amyloid percursor protein (APP) and
presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2. PS-1 is responsible for AD familial type 3
and is part of the Ɣ-secretase complex involved in APP processing to Aβ.

Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> is an antioxidant in mitochondrial membranes and
facilitates the efficient transport of electrons and protects against oxidative
injury.

This study uses PS-1 mutated AD familial type 3 fibroblasts (PSAF) and healthy
skin fibroblasts to examine the therapeutic effect of water soluble
coenzymeQ<sub>10</sub>. They found that the PSAF had higher ROS levels than the
healthy fibroblasts as well as p53, p21 and p16Ink4a - proteins involved in
cellular senescence.

PSAF cultured with the coenzymeQ showed lower levels of senescence markers like
p21 and no changes in p53 suggesting that the water soluble coenzymeQ is able to
delay the onset of SIPS. It also maintained proliferation status in PSAF and
reduced the levels of ROS in the PSAFs and in mitochondria isolated from them.

In AD, studies have reported deficits in autophagy needed for the degradation
and recycling of dangerous intracellular components. The water soluble
coenzymeQ was able to partly restore the autophagic activity in PSAF.
