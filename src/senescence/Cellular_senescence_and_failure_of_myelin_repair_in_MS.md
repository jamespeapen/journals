This review examined the role of cellular senescence and remyelination failure
in MS. OPCs are responsible for the myelination of neurons in the brain when
they differentiate into oligodendrocytes in response to microglial signalling.
Senescent microglia show dysfunctional degradation which inhibits OPC
differentiation into oligodendrocytes. OPC senescence is associated with ageing
and exposure to amyloid-beta oligomers, with expression of p16, p21 and
senescence-associated beta galactosidase. Some SASP components secreted by
senescent cells could interfere with myelination. Senescence also affects other
cells like astrocytes, microglia and neurons. Treating senescent astrocytes with
rapamycin restored astrocyte ability to support OPC differentiation. Senescence
in the BBB increases its permeability and the entry of fibrinogen can interfere
with the differentiation of OPCs and affect remyelination. Treatments with
senolytics reduced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits which shows that
senescence could contribute to the state of neuroinflammation and to the loss of
cognitive function.

Myelin is negatively related to age and loss of myelin could contribute to AD
pathology. A number of cell types have been shown to become senescent on
exposure to amyloid or tau in AD brains and other papers have shown that myelin
disruption is found in AD and could be an early feature. TREM2 which is an AD
associated gene is involved in myelin debris removal. When the myelin debris
overwhelms microglia, they can become senescent and myelination an be affected.
