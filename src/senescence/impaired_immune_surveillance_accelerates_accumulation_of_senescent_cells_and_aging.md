Cellular senescence is a component of ageing that prevents damaged cells from
proliferating and spreading that damage. Senescent cells are normally removed by
the immune system and cells in that tissue regenerate. Senescence is also part
of ageing and the efficiency of senescent cell removal decreases with age
leading to an accumulation of senescent cells. With accumulation, the
beneficial effects of senescence are outweighed by its negative effects.

Perforin-mediated granule exocytosis is necessary for immune surveillance of
senescent cells in damaged livers. This study used perforin knockout mice to
understand the consequences of impaired immune surveillance.

## Results

The results showed that perforin deficiency accelerates senescence with age. In
WT mice senescent cells made up 10% of the examined tissue while in the preforin
knockout mice, it was 43% at 24 months. The expression of p16, another
senescence marker, increased more in the KO mice than the WT. This senescence
increase was tested with a number of other known senescence markers and shown to
be consistent.

Along with the increase in senescent cell numbers, there was also an increase in
age-dependent chronic inflammation with increased cytokine expression and
more tissue-infiltrating immune cells. In 24 month-old mice there was an
increase in serum cytokine levels and pro-inflammatory factors, but not in 2 and
12 month-old mice. The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is accompanied
by an increased inflammatory response.

Loss of perforin also resulted in age-related disorders like fibrosis in various
organs, loss of the subcutaneous fat layer, and loss of hair follicles. An
examination of their blood for tissue damage markers found tissue damage in
internal organs as well as increased urea levels, probably from kidney damage.
The KO mice were less active and had poorer grip strength and coordination that
the WT mice. Further, these mice also had a decreased lifespan than the WT mice.

They also used a mouse with the *LMNA* gene mutation which resulted in
senescent cell accumulation. These mice, when crossed with those with the
preforin deficiency, acquired the deficiency and their lifespans were shorter
than the mice with just the *LMNA* gene mutation. This suggests that despite an
increased senescent cell burden, a functioning immune surveillance system can
help to slow senescence-induced ageing.

## Senolytic treatment

Using the ABT-737 senolytic resulted in decreased senescent cell burden, reduced
inflammation and immune cell infiltration, and increased activity and lifespan.
The treatment drove the expression of SASP genes down to levels found in young
mice, counteracting the effect of ageing.

In the mice with the *LMNA* mutation, treatment extended their lifespan and
decreased the senescent cell burden and cytokine levels.

If senolytic treatments are able to preserve the benefits of senescence, they
could be part of therapeutics for age-related diseases and ameliorate the
negative effects of ageing.
