The SASP can prevent cancer progression through autocrine and paracrine
senescence and activate the immune system to clear damaged cells. However, the
SASP can also promote tumorigenic processes like angiogenesis and invasion.
During ageing the SASP can lead to chronic inflammation and spread of senescence
into neighboring cells. lncRNAs could be important in regulating SASP genes.
*MIR310HG* knock-down in BRAF-induced senescent fibroblasts reduced expression
and secretion of SASP components.

They found that *MIR310HG* depletion during oncogene induced senescence affected
the SASP as they did not upregulate the main components of the SASP. These cells
without the *MIR310HG* produced less IL6 and CXCL1, SASP inflammatory factors.

Their examination of the paracrine effects of *MIR310HG* showed that the
knock-down did not affect the senescence but did affect the induction of
paracrine invasion. The depletion also resulted in reduced CEBPB and NF-ÎºB
activation in oncogene-induced senescence as well as decreased IL1A translation.

Senescence-targeting therapies try to affect the SASP without changing the
tumor-suppressive benefits of senescence and *MIR310HG* is able to reduce
senescence invasion without affecting the growth arrest. Overall they've found
that depletion of *MIR310HG* results in p16 induction without SASP activation
and decreases the pro-invasive factors of the SASP.
