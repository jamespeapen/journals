This paper identifies SASP, a hallmark of cellular senescence. This phenotype is
particularly enhanced by the gain of "oncogenic RAS or loss of p53 function".

While there were differences between the way the phenotype was expressed between
different cells, there were also similarities between them indicating that there
is a "conserved core secretory program that any cell undergoing senescence would
trigger". They all had "high levels of secreted inflammatory cytokines, immune
modulators, and gwowth factors, suggenting that SASPs might have myriad
biological activities".  They found that tumor cells were very likely to become
senescent in response to DNA damage.  Senescent cells create a "proinflammatory
environment".

Although senescent cells tend to be removed by the immune system, they increase
in number with age. This may be because aging or age-related related pathologies
dampen immune response and/or increase the rate at which senescent cells are
produced.

The authors suggest that senescence has both beneficial and detrimental effects
because of antagonistic pleiotropy which may be explained as a "consequence of
the declining force of natural selection with age." Older individuals are fewer
in number because of extrinsic hazards and natural selection tends to favor
traits that promote "early life fitness" at the cost of longevity.
