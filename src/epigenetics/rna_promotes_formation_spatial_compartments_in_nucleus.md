The process of transcription can affect the formation of nuclear spatial
compartments. Using RNA and DNA SPRITE to map RNA including pre-mRNAs, ncRNAs
they study how RNA mediates nuclear compartmentalization.

The process involves three steps:

1. Seeding: nuclear RNA builds up concentrations close to where they were
   transcribed

2. Binding: they bind diffusible ncRNA and proteins

3. Recruiting: change the distribution of these diffusible molecules to
   preferentially enrich them within precise high-concentration areas.

> By recruiting diffusible regulatory factors to multiple DNA sites, these ncRNAs
> may also act to drive coalescence of distinct DNA regions into a shared
> territory in the nucleus...
> RNA may represent a widespread class of molecules that act as seeds to drive
> spatial organization of diffusible molecules.

### Why RNA

This precise spatial behaviour is possible because RNA is unlike proteins and
DNA - proteins form through translation in the cytoplasm and have no nuclear
location information; DNA is singular and cannot accumulate. Further, ncRNAs are
unlike mRNA, which needs translation and does interact with regulators in the
nucleus. However, RNA with function independent of their translated product can
have similar effects:

>  histone pre-mRNAs can seed organization of nuclear compartments even though
>  their processed RNAs are also translated into protein products.

lncRNAs (93%) are enriched near their transcriptional loci while mature mRNAs
are depleted. These are some lncRNAs that, despite high enrichment, are not
restricted to their transcriptional loci. lncRNAs were shown more stable than
nascent pre-mRNA, comparable to the stability of mature mRNA, even after
transcriptional inhibition.

Inhibiting the formation of nascent RNA showed no structural changes in
chromosome territories or A/B compartments but, in the nuclear structures
associated with ribosome, snRNA and histone biogenesis, it did disrupt DNA and
RNA organization.

### ncRNA processing hubs around DNA that encodes their nascent targets

They found that "ncRNAs form processing hubs around genomic DNA encoding their
nascent targets":

> - ncRNAs involved in ribosomal RNA processing organize around  transcribed
>   ribosomal RNA genes
> 
> - ncRNAs involved in mRNA splicing are spatially concentrated around genes
>   containing a high density of Pol II
> 
> - ncRNAs involved in snRNA biogenesis are organized around snRNA gene clusters
> 
> - The histone processing U7 snRNA is enriched around histone gene loci

### ncRNAs influence gene expression regulation

Hundreds of lncRNAs are enriched in 'territories' in the nucleus and affect
protein localization within them. Proteins may bind to ncRNAs and get localized
to their territories. This recruitment, depending on what's recruited, can
affect gene expression within the territory.
