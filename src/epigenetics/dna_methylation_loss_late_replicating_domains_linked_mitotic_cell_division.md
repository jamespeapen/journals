This study identifies four influencers of DNA methylation levels in human and
mouse genomes. 

### Local sequence context of the CpG dinucleotide

CpG density and the **WCGW**[CpG flanked by A or T]{.aside} sequence context
strongly influence the rate of DNA methylation loss at individual CpGs within
the Partially Methylated Domains (PMDs). Their influences are constant between
cell types and species. Solo-WCGW CpGs are prone to hypomethylation, possibly
because DNMT1 has increased efficiency when there are multiple CpG sites close
together.

### Timing of DNA replication

Replication timing is a determinant of methylation levels at H3K36me3 negative
CpGs like Solo-WCGW CpGs. Replication late in the S phase does not give the cell
enough time to remethylate the daughter strands. Methylation during mitosis can
be slow and may not fully be completed until the S-G2 checkpoint.

### H3K36me3 histone mark

The presence of H3K36me3 can override the methylation loss associated with
late-replication. H3K36me3 helps to maintain DNA methylation at marked CpGs by
the recruitment of DNMT3B to the trimethylated nucleosomes. In carcinomas with
*NSD1* mutations and loss of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, there is a loss of DNA
methylation in areas of typically high methylation.

### Accumulated number of cell divisions

PMD hypomethylation can accumulate despite DNA methylation maintenance
machinery - genes associated with cell division and proliferation are also
associated with PMD hypomethylation. The cumulative cell divisions can be a
driver of PMD hypomethylation.
