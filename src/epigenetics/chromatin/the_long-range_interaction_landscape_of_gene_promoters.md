Using 5C maps of cell lines this study investigated long range interactions
between promoters and distal sites including enhancers, other promoters, and
CTCF-bound sites. The locations studies were part of 44 ENCODE pilot project
regions spanning 1% of the genome containing regions between 500 kb and 1.9 Mb
with 628 TSS and 4,535 distal elements in the fragments. Within a regions, loci
close to each other interact more than loci further apart. Similarly, loci on
the same chromosome interact more often than loci on different chromosomes
because of the formation of chromosome territories.

They found correlations between gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions
and enhancer RNA (eRNA). The long-range interactions tended to be with elements
~120kb upstream of the TSS and were not blocked by CTCF-bound sites. These
genomic elements and their multiple interactions form networks. They show that
the nearest gene is not a good predictor of long-range interactions as only 7%
of the looping interactions were with the nearest gene. Looping interactions
were composed of enchancer, weak enchancers, CTCF elements, and actively
transcribed chromatin but did not have as much repressed chromatin. Looking at
eRNAs, they found that enchancers looping to TSSs are more likely to express
eRNAs than non-looping enhancers. Expressed TSSs have more interactions with
enhancers, promoters and CTCF than non-expressed TSSs. CTCF interactions seemed
to block 58% of interactions at sites with CTCF and cohesin.
