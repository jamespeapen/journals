DNA methylation of the 5mC is associated with transcriptional repression and
through that repression affects genomic imprinting X chromosome
inactivation, repressing transposons and germline-specific genes. The
methylation enables a higher mutation rate as 5mC is deaminated to a thymine,
which when paired with A, is not easily repaired. Most cancer types show a
dysregulation of DNA methylation.

The mammalian genome undergoes major epigenetic reprogramming after
fertilization and germline cell specification.

### Cellular functions of DNA methylation

DNMT3A and DNMT3B are the two major de novo DNA methylation enzymes. They have a
highly conserved methyltransferase domain and two chromatin reading domains.

The bodies of actively transcribed genes are enriched with DNA methylation,
while active promoters are unmethylated. De novo methylation can occur in any
sequence context, but only the methylation in CpG contexts are preserved through
cell division by the methylation maintenance enzyme DNMT1 working with the E3
ubiquitin ligase UHRF1.

Demethylation is done by TET that oxidises methylated cytosine. Oxidised forms
of C can promote demethylation during replication.

Gene bodies tend to be quite heavily methylated which is paradoxical since
methylation makes mutagenesis more likely. It may be because it facilitates
transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing. It may also repress
intragenic cryptic promoters.

#### CpG-island promoter methylation

Most of mammalian promoters are CpG-islands that are rarely methylated. They are
methylated in the cases on X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and in
germline specific genes.

Genomic imprinting is when genes expression is controlled based on whether the
gene was inherited from the father or mother. Germline-specific genes need to be
repressed with the onset of somatic differentiation during implantation.

#### Retrotransposons

The main targets of DNA methylation are retrotransposons that occupy around half
of the genomic space. Their expression is controlled by CpG-rich promoters whose
methylation is necessary for silencing them. DNMT3C is a newly discovered de
novo DNMT specifically working to control retrotransposons. DNA methylation also
serves to inactivate retrotransposons through increased mutagenesis by
deamination.

### Methylation patterning in development

Reprogramming occurs first after fertilization where the embryo loses
gamete-specific DNA methylation patterns. Then there is a gradual loss of
methylation until the blastocyst stage. However, there remains substantial
methylation after the global demethylation processes which could possibly imply
the existence of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance or transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance.

Sex-specific patterns of methylation are established in germlines. Sperm have
80% CpG methylation while oocytes have 50% methylation.

### Methylation and disease

DNMT1 mutations are associated with neurological disorders like hereditary
sensory autonomic neuropathy 1E with dementia and hearing loss. DNMT3B mutations
are found in immunodeficiency diseases. Heterozygous, germline mutations in
*DNMT3A* are associated with growth disorders of early prenatal onset. Somatic
mutations of this gene are linked to adult cancers like acute myeloid leukaemia.

Demethylation gene mutations are also linked to cancers like AML through *TET2*
mutations.
