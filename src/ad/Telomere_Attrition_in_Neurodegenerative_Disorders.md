# Telomere Attrition in Neurodegenerative Disorders

[Full text](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00219/full)

Telomere attrition is found in a number of disorders and studies have tried to
understand the relationship between TL length and these disorders. This paper
reviews the literature concerning TL, AD, and PD. Telomere length is maintained
by telomerase and, while its activity in the brain decreases after birth, there
is high activity in neuronal stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells. There are
only inconsistent results between cognitive performance and TL. 

Results in AD studies have been contradictory. Telomere shortening and reduced
telomerase activity was found in rat microglial cells, but in aged telomerase
knockout mice had decreased progression of amyloid plaque pathology. The authors
think small study cohorts may be responsible for the inconsistencies since a
meta-analysis showed more consistent evidence for shorter telomeres in AD.

They concluded that telomere length is a questionable biomarker for clinical
use because it has low specificity and sensitivity. It could still be important
because it is unclear whether telomere length is a cause or consequence of
age-related disorders, but should be understood in the context of other markers.

It was interesing because I expected telomeres to be reliable biomarkers since
they are a major part of cellular senescence. However, with better methods and
the longitudinal studies that the authors recommend, there may be important
relationships to be discovered that could contribute to the explanation of AD
pathogenesis and the role of senescence.
