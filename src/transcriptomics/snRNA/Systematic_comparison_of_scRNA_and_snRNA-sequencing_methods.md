# Systematic comparison of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing methods {.unnumbered}

[Nature biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0465-8)

scRNA-seq methods:

- low-throughput, plate-based:
  - sort a cell into a well of multi-well plates
- high-throughput bead-based:
  - distribute cell suspension into droplets or wells containing reagent
    and barcoded beads
  - each droplet contains one cell and and bead that will mark all the DNA
    from that cell

This paper compares seven methods of RNA-seq and analyzes a number of different
cell types. For each sample they characterized the performance of the sequencing
method.
