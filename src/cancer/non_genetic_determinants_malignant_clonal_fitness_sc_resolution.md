Cancer cell evolution has been considered a genetically driven process where a
cell acquires an advantageous mutation that allows it to better proliferate or
evade therapeutics. Alternatively cells can also have non-genetic, but
heritable, mechanisms of evolution that give it a selection advantage.

This paper uses AML as a model to study evolution since it only has one mutation
that is necessary and sufficient to cause tumor formation allowing them to
easily study non-genetic evolutionary forces. They individually barcoded cells
to track them and transplanted them into mice. They found that AML stem cells
and more mature progenitor cells were both causing disease with similar
proliferation rates. The clonal differences were not a result of the cell of
origin. While this demonstrated the non-genetic component, they also saw that
descendants of the same barcoded cell became dominant in different mice, showing
that the trait was heritable, if unstable.

They then examined the role of _Kras_ and _Flt3_ oncogene mutations that occur
in clonal populations. The dominant clones had a higher expression of _Slpi_, a
gene for an anti-inflammatory protein and a downregulation of immune-related
genes like MHC components. 

These properties may be made heritable through DNA methylation that silences
tumor suppressor genes. scATAC-seq showed reduced chromatin accessibility for
_B2m_ which is part of the MHC ssytem. There are also key transcription factors
that allow the treatment resistant phenotypes to stabilize and propagate.
