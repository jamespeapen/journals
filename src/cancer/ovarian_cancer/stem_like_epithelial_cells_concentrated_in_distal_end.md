The fallopian tube contains ciliated cells that move gametes through the lumen
and secretory cells that produce a nutrient rich fluid for them. The distal end
of the fallopian tube is exposed to a monthly cycle of inflammatory agents and
the fallopian tube is cyclically regenerating, suggesting regenerative capacity.
A rare cell type has been seen in the fallopian tube, concentrated in the distal
end, called an intercalary cell or a peg cell that shows neither marks of
ciliated or secretory cells. This paper shows an adult stem cell population in
the fallopian tube epithelium by characterizing these peg cells. 

The constant exposure to inflammatory compounds increases the risk for damage in
the fallopian tube. There is also evidence that serous cancers have their origin
in the fallopian tube as tumor cells exfoliate and migrate to the ovaries. FTE
stem cells do not express the best-known tumor marker for serous cancers, MUC16,
which may explain why MUC16 is not found in early screening for serous cancers.
