Cancer cells with the same genetic background can have different phenotypic
states that help them survive, invade, metastasize, and resist therapies. To
understand their plasticity, it is important to identify their individual cell
states or the cell states of their cell-of-origin since the cell-of-origin
states may be recapitulated in the daughter cells. HGSOC cells are difficult to
stratify and have transcriptomic heterogeneity. This work analyzed the cellular
states present in HGSOC tumors.

They first found that overnight and long-term culture introduced changes in
gene-expression that could introduce significant biases in the data. So they
used fresh tissue and removed cells expressing *FOS* and *JUN* as part of a
stress reponse from sample preparation.

In the cleaned dataset they identified five cell states: EMT, cell cycle,
differentiated, KRT17, and ciliated. The EMT population expressed *KRT7* and
*EPCAM* and EMT score was associated with poor survival independently of other
factors and had a high sensitivity in identifying poor prognoses. They also
found a population that expressed both a secretory marker KRT7 and a ciliated
marker CAPS. This population was thought to represent an intermediate between
secretory and ciliated cell types.

Using the five identified subtypes, they took bulk RNA-seq data and deconvolved
the cell populations. The ciliated tumor subtype was highly enriched in
low-grade HGSOC which suggested to them that the grades of of SOC are associated
with their ability to differentiate into cells that look like ciliated cells. Or
the enrichment of ciliated markers is a distinguishing feature of low-grade
tumors.
