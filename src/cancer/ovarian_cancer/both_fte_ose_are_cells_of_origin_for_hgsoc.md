There is debate over whether the cell-of-origin for High Grade Serous Ovarian
Cancer (HGSOC) is from the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) or the ovarian
surface epithelium. This study used mice and organoids to assess the tumor
forming capacities of FTE and OSE that had the same tumorigenic potential. Most
HGSOC transcriptomes look more like FTE and OSE, but there are around 12% of
HGSOC that do look transcriptomically like OSE. There may be two subtypes
depending on their cell-of-origin with OSE-derived tumors holding a worse
prognosis.

They found that perturbing *Tp53* and the RB family in FTE *Pax8+* cells causes STIC
lesions and metastasis, which are typically PAX8+. HGSOC is also not known to
express ciliated cell markers and ciliated cells were not found in the FTE
organoids that became tumors suggesting that the inactivating the RB family
restricts differentiation to the secretory lineage. The same perturbations in
OSE also result in HGSOC. There were over 8000 differentially expressed genes
between the two cancer subtypes with known FT or OSE specific genes being
expressed as expected. The cell-of-origin also affected tumor response to
chemotherapeutic agents. FTE-derived tumors disseminated more while the
OSE-derived tumors were less frequently metastatic.
