The fallopian tube contains epithelial cells, stromal cells and immune cells.
This study makes an atlas of these cell types and subtypes in normal and
diseased conditions. They find four ciliated and six non-ciliated secretory
cells. According to their analysis, two of the secretory subtypes represent
potential progenitors of secretory, ciliated and stromal cells.

Secretory cells are marked by PAX8<sup>+</sup>/KRT7<sup>+</sup>, ciliated cells
by FOXJ1<sup>+</sup>/CAPS<sup>+</sup> and peg cells by
EPCAM<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup>/ITGA6<sup>+</sup>. These peg cells can
generate ciliated and secretory cells *in vitro* which led to them being
considered progenitor cells. Their decrease was associated with a decrease in
ovarian cancer risk suggesting that peg cells were the cell of origin for HGSOC.

Interestingly, as an example of transcriptional heterogeneity,
one of the ciliated cell subtypes, CE1-3 was a transitional population that had
the markers of both ciliated and secretory cells. They also observed
transcriptomic differences across the anatomic segments they studied. Gene
expression values showed some differences for each cell type in each of the FT
segments. Genes may be dynamically regulated to achieve normal reproduction or
in response to disease.

They found two groups of progenitor cells, both secretory subtypes. One were the
precursors of mature secretory cells and the others had a bifurcating trajectory
leading to either ciliated cells or stromal cells.

They address a paper that identified two transitional populations with
pseudotime. One of these was purported to be a RUNX3<sup>+</sup> progenitor
population, but the data from this study did not support it. RUNX3<sup>+</sup>
is a marker for T and natural killer cells and is not expressed highly in the
other epithelial cells. The highest expression of RUNX3 in epithelial cells is
in a secretory subtype that is not a predicted progenitor according to RNA
velocity.
