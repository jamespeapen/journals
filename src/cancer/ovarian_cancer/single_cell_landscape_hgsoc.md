Intra-tumor heterogeneity of tumor and associated cells can drive treatment
resistance in ovarian cancer. Ascites are malignant abdominal fluid collections
that develop in women with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and
can be treatment resistant with a poor prognosis. Here they study ascite
expression profiles to see how they may contribute to the disease.

They identified 18 cell clusters of epithelial cells, macrophages,
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), dentritic cells, T cells and erythrocytes.
Immune cells were the most abundant component of the samples which is a problem
for analysis in malignant effusions. 

A subest of CAFs in non-malignant cells expressed immunomodulatory programs with
pro-inflammatory signalling. This may contribute to tumor growth promotion and
drug resistance.

The TCGA described four subtypes of ovarian cancer: differentiated,
profliferative, mesenchymal and immmunoreactive. Their clustering showed a
differentiated and profliferative signature, but not the mesenchymal and
immmunoreactive ones. They suggest these subtypes may represent the
intra-tumoral abundance of CAFs and macrophages rather than a tumor subtype.
Bulk RNA-based classification may reflect the tumor ecosystem better than they
do the tumor cell subtypes. They suggest increased CAF infiltration may
contribute to the poor treatment response.

They then examined how expression programs varied among each sample's tumor
cells. Using NMF they identified 35 modules with co-varying gene expression.
They had different functions from cell cycle to inflammation and stress. They
also had stemness and mesenchymal markers. Comparing modules across patients to
find shared cancer cell programs between them they found cell cycle modules and
programs dominated by immune and inflammation genes. 

CAFs highly expressed genes for ligands that activate the JAK/STAT pathway and
signalling genes showed similar patterns in both malignant and non-malignant
cells. Cancer cell sub-populations expressed immune-related programs potentially
downstream of the JAK/STAT pathway. This shared activation of JAK/STAT between
cancer cells and CAFs may contribute to malignant pathogenesis and drug
resistance. They determined the impact of JAK/STAT inhibition with and drug
screen. JSI-124 showed anti-tumor activity and reduced disease burden in the
models.

While most variation between the cancer cells was inter-patient, there was
intra-patient variation, some of which was consistent across multiple patients.
There were subsets of malignant cells expressing the MHC class II program and
could be associated with an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte numbers,
and improved prognosis and treatment response. They hypothesize that
interactions between CAFs and macrophages in the ascites ecosystem regulate or
enhance cancre cell-autonomous programs as seen n the JAK/STAT signalling
pathway.

A larger patient cohort would provide tests of generality for programs they
identified in only one patient.
