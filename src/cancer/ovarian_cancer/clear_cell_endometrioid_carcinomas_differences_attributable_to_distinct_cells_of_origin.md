Both clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) and endometriod ovarian carcinoma
(ENOC) are associated with ovarian endometriotic cysts. It is unknown how
endometriosis can result in two different cancer types, especially when there
are no mutations that are unique to either type.

The proteomic analysis in this paper identified cystathionine-$\gamma$-lyase
(CTH) as highly expressed in CCOC compared to the other types of cancer. CTH is
strongly expressed in ciliated cells, endometrium, endometriosis and fallopian
tubes. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1) and estrogen receptor
(ER) were found at higher levels in ENOC than CCOC. They propose that the
ciliated or secretory cellular contexts explain how endometriosis can lead to
both CCOC and ENOC.

In this model CCOC comes from cells with ciliated cell features and ENOC tumors
from secretory cells or precursor secretory cells. The endometrial progenitor
cell can differentiate towards a secretory or ciliated cell depending on the
ovarian micro-environment. In the endometrioma, progenitor cells are exposed to
inflammation, haemorrhagic cyst contests and the ovarian stromal
micro-environment. Since ciliated cells are terminally differentiated, it may be
progenitor cells that are on the ciliated cell trajectory, but has not yet
matured fully that gives rise to CCOC. Endometriosis contains high levels of
IL-6 which can promote ciliated cell differentiation. ROS plus IL-6 may drive
endometrial cells to CCOC, but without these stimuli the oncogenic
transformation would lead to ENOC.
