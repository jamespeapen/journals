Ovarian cancer shows signs of having a cancer stem cell (CSC) hierarchy where a
stem cell can self-renew and differentiate into progenitor cells that go on to
differentiate further into the cells that make up the tumor. The apex stem cell
can stay in a quiescent state for long periods making them difficult to target
with anti-mitotic agents. Despite the evidence, isolating, identifying, and
growing CSCs is difficult. Ovarian cancer in particular has a serious
chemoresistant recurrence problem that CSCs likely contribute significantly to.

One of the main ways to identify CSCs is by cell surface proteins (like CD
proteins) and stemness markers (like ALDH). These markers can be used in flow
cytometry to isolate the cells of interest and then assay them for their
self-renewal and differentiation capabilities.

### Isolation

Ovarian CSCs can be isolated by their expression of ALDH1 in combination with CD
markers like CD133. ALDH+/CD133+ cells are the most stem like at the top of the
hierarchy. ALDH+/CD133- cells are less stem-like than the double positive cells,
but more than ALDH-/CD133- cells. ALDH is, however, not required for the
stemness characteristics of CSCs and its loss does not impact tumorigenicity.

The use of CD proteins requires prior knowledge of the cell surface expression
of the protein an dare not required for CSC properties. CD133 is one of the best
methods for identifying ovarian CSCs. CD24 is another marker that can be used,
but has inconsistent results in classifying cells as stem-like between patient
samples and cell lines. While CD44 is one of the better known markers, it cannot
delineate between the different stem and progenitor cells in the hierarchy. Both
CD133 and ALDH expression are linked to poor prognosis making them diagnostic
markers as well.

The ability to form spheroids is yet another method to isolate stem cells since
there is evidence that the spheroid-forming ability characterizes CSCs. Isolated
putative stem cells can be validated using assays like single-cell asymmetric
division.

### Targeting CSCs

CSCs are known to be chemoresistant. Therapies aimed at CSCs need to treat with
chemotherapies in addition to anti-CSC measures. Unilateral therapy methods are
predicted to fail by a Clonal Cancer Stemness model. Inhibiting Notch
signalling, which is [necessary to maintain
stemness](src/cell_type_state/notch_wnt_regulate_stemness_differentiation_fte.md),
decreases metastasis in mouse models when combined with cisplatin. CSCs can
adapt their expression profiles to form recurrent chemoresistant tumors.

However, we do not know whether CSCs are inherently resistant to therapy or are
able to adapt and develop resistance. One way to combat the quiescence-based
resistance to chemotherapies is to force the CSCs to exit quiescence and
proliferate. The creation of a stable model that can remain in a self-renewal
state is necessary to identify therapeutic targets. They are currently not
stable enough because the necessary culture conditions have not been identified.
Spheroid conditions hold promise in maintaining the stem-like state and work on
signalling will reveal the signalling factors necessary to maintain it.
