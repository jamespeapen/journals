Although there is evidence for the cancer stem cell theory, not much was known
about the ovarian cancer stem cell system and how it operated. This paper
characterized the stem cell hierarchy, showing the different cell identities
and demonstrating that it was, in fact, a hierarchy and not just stochastically
driven.

They confirmed that ALDH and CD133 are good markers for the stem cells that
separate them into

> distinct heterogeneous populations of ovarian cancer stem cells.

These markers could also identify a population of normal ovarian stem cells
suggesting ALDH^+^CD133^+^ cells may be involved in the cell of cancer origin.

Both the ALDH^+^CD133^+^ cells and ALDH^+^CD133^-^ could engraft into mice, but
the double positives generated tumors faster. ALDH^-^CD133^-^ cells could not
form tumors or produce any of the other cells in the heirarchy, while the double
positives could produce all the cells in the hierarchy. Both ALDH^+^CD133^-^ and
ALDH^-^CD133^+^ cells could self-renew and produce double negatives.

Their study involved modulating BMP2 levels to perturb the hierarchy and force
cells in one direction or the other.  Both BMP2 and its inhibitor Noggin
restrict cancer growth in vitro. One of the goals of the study was to reconcile
the differences seen between in vivo and in vitro studies using BMP2: in vivo
increases in BMP2 resulted in increased tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance
but, in vitro, bulk cell proliferation is suppressed. Treatment with cisplatin
and BMP2 increased the absolute number of double-positives, but treatment with
Noggin and cisplatin decreased absolute CSC numbers. In tumor initiation tests,
cisplatin and Noggin together decrease tumor initiation capacity compared to
cisplatin alone and were smaller than tumors treated with BMP2 and cisplatin.

The double negative cells have the highest expression of BMP2, producing it to
stimulate the self-renewal of the double-positives while inhibiting the
proliferation of the middle progenitor groups. They believe this twofold purpose
is key to the complexity underlying the discrepancy they see. In vitro, BMP2
treatment reduced the absolute cell numbers by limiting proliferation of the
double negative population, but in vitro growth from BMP2 treatment has more to
do with the increase in stem cells. Ovarian cancer shows upregulation of BMP2
and patient prognosis is correlated with BMP2 expression. Fully reconciling the
contrasting results will require studies on the receptors involved in BMP2
pathways. They did see one rare stoachastic even where an ALDH^+^CD133^-^ cell
produced a double positive cell.
