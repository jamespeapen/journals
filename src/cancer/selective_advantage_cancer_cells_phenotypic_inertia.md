Cells deal with stress by changing things like transcription that are not
genetically encoded. Expanded tumor sub-clones are characterized by disruption
in their epigenetic regulatory networks that mediate the cellular response to
environmental cues.This study looked at how successful cancer cells behave in
the face of stressors and found that those with epigenetic disruptions did not
change their behaviour like normal cells did.

They inactivated many regulators of chromatin and DNA methylation which led to
conserved effects independent of the effects in the context of individual genes.
Then, by selecting cells with deregulated epigenetic networks, they showed that
these populations had more proliferating cells and fewer apoptotic cells that
control cell populations. This fitness came from more cells surviving shortly
after stress. These cells were also able to out-compete normal cells. Epigenetic
control disruption helps cells cope with environmental stressors and, despite
disruption of the different regulators, arrive at a common phenotype that aids
survival. This selects for these disrupted cells during cancer evolution.

This evolution, is not however, driven by genetic changes as stress-resistant
phenotypes, caused by inhibiting epigenetic regulators that confer
stress-resistance, can be reversed when the stressor is removed. However, they
have enhanced plasticity that lets them reversibly adjust their behaviour in
response to changes in their environment. This plasticity is demonstrated in an
unusual way: phenotypic inertia. Rather than showing adaptation, they show a
lack of response to stress that prevents them from responding to poor conditions
by reducing proliferation or inducing apoptosis. By effectively ignoring
short-term stress, they are able to survive and continue growing. To show that
inertia is a better than plasticity as a way to describe this phenomenon, they
profiled those cellular transcriptomes. While control cells downregulated genes
for cell metabolism and proliferation, the disrupted cells did not show an
upregulation of stress response genes. This was confirmed by examining their
OXPHOS which decrease under stress. Unlike the control cells, the epigenetically
disrupted cells did not show any decrease in OXPHOS when exposed to stress. This
lack of change supports the inertia idea more than a plasticity one.

Similarly, they showed with scRNA-seq that the disrupted cells do not adopt
different cellular states or rewire any cellular programs to deal with stress
like control cell populations did.

To investigate the mechanism of inertia, they examined transcriptional bursting
dynamics. Genes with high burst frequencies in an unperturbed state showed the
greatest changes when perturbed. Stress genes, which are low frequency genes in
an unperturbed state, did not change much in their frequency. A normal response
to stress begins with reductions in transcriptional activity, particularly in genes
with high burst frequencies while low-frequency genes are unregulated. When
epigenetically disrupted, cells cannot reorganize their chromatin to respond to
stress which leads to what they call "transcriptional numbness" that helps them
tolerate these transient stressors. The transcriptional numbness seen here is
adopted by cells with disrupted epigenetic machinery while normal cells can use
both plasticity and inertia to deal with stress.

Phenotypic inertia continues proliferation while delaying the activation of
apoptotic programs by raising individual cell stress thresholds. A similar
mechanism may also be responsible for cells that ignore differentiation cues and
remain in a self-renewing state. It could also explain resistance to therapies
that need transcriptional changes to work.
