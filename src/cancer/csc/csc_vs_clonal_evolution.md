The cancer stem cell model postulates that there are a few tumorigenic stem
cells that give rise to the majority of the tumor cell population and these
cells are the ones that can self-renew and grow the tumor. This means therapies
for cancers driven by these stem cells need only target the stem cells to remove
the tumor.

There is quite a lot of evidence for the cancer stem cell model, primarily from
the fact that in certain cancers, tumorigenic cells can be distinguished from
non-tumorigenic cells. This characterizes cancer stem cells: if there are two
populations of tumor cells, this suggests a hierarchy in the tumor cells where
some cells are able to both differentiate and self-renew. The differences
between the stem cells and the differentiated cells would have to be epigenetic
since it is unlikely that only some cells have the genetic ability to
proliferate. This ability to distinguish between them does come with a caveat:
sometimes there are non-neoplastic cells in tumors that may be seen as
'non-tumorigenic' or debris from the sample may be classified as a real
non-tumorigenic cell.

Further, the epigenetic changes need to be confirmed since just the presence of
both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells does not confirm a stem cell
hierarchy: genetic and environmental factors can also explain that and be
consistent with a clonal evolution model. At this point there was no evidence
that the difference was epigenetic rather than genetic. Although CSCs may be
important in some cancers, the clonal evolution process is important in all
cancers.

The cancer stem cell model deals with the tumorigenic potential of cells, not
their fate. We can use data to figure out what cell populations may lead to
cancer, but whether they do depends on the individual and that would be hard to
study. Therapies are driven by the consideration of tumorigenic potential since
it would be dangerous to ignore any potentially tumorigenic cells. However what
cells are fated to become tumorigenic is context dependent.

Despite the evidence for cancer stem cells, there remain some problems. The
evidence for CSCs from immunocompromised mice that grew tumors from transplanted
human cells may underestimate the frequency of human cancer cells with
tumorigenic potential. Fewer human cells are required to start a tumor in
immunocompromised mice than they would in humans. Further, tumor heterogeneity
after transplantation was quantified using only a few cell surface markers and
not with any genetic tests. Some markers like CD133 do not distinguish between
tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells in certain cancers which means markers
alone are not a reliable assay for therapy efficacy. The degree to which
these mouse models recapitulate the human environment is also unclear and
incompatibilities between mice and human receptors and ligands may confound
results.

It is also important to define cancer stem cells. Although conflated with tumor
cells of origin which are normal cells that turn cancerous, the cancer stem cell
model does not address the cell of origin. They should also not be confused with
the origin of a clonal population because that is a different model for cancer.
