Axonal lesions are a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, MS,
and Alzheimer's disease. The response to these lesions is the axon reaction and
includes metabolic and structural changes in the lesioned nerve cells and an
activation of surrounding glial cells. This innate immune response can have
beneficial and harmful effects.

They removed the ventral root in two strains of adult rats and found that the
ensuing neurodegeneration had the activation of astrocytes and microglia and
upregulation of immunological compounds. The DA strain represents an injury
susceptible model and the PVG represents an injury resistant one.  Their DA
strain had more glial activation and greater lesioned motorneuron loss compared
to the PVG strain.  This differences between the strains could show the
importance of susceptibility to inflammatory disease in humans.

The largest group of upregulated genes were part of an immunological and
inflammatory gene group and these were more expressed in the strain susceptible
to neurodegeneration.
