Dystrophic microglia are beaded and fragmented compared to normal microglia and
are thought to be a form of microglial senescence. They have been found in aged
humans without neurodegenerative pathologies but the authors suggest that it is
associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Studying human brains between 10 and 100 years of age, they found that
dystrophic microglia were present at a greater frequency in brains with
neurodegenerative pathology than in those without. It the brains with
pathologies, they found a strong association of ferritin light chain which is
responsible for storing intracellular iron with dystrophic microglia.

There was no clear pattern of increased microglial dystrophy with age in the
hippocampus or white matter, but there was an increase in the proportion of
dystrophic microglia in the frontal cortex. Overall, dystrophic microglia were
associated with neurodegenerative disease status.
