This paper explores the role of the immune system in the brain with regards to
inflammation. They found that natural killer cells played important roles in the
immune surveillance of the aged brain and outnumber other immune cell types. NK
cell surveillance is triggered when brain cells become senescent. NK cells play
a key role in the decline of neurogenesis and cognition during normal brain
ageing.

NK cells were found to preferentially accumulate in the dentate gyrus, but not
in adjacent areas. They hypothesized that there were focal factors that bridged
the interactions between NK cells and dentate gyrus cells. This was confirmed by
the increased presence of Ki67-expressing NK cells and higher proliferative
activity of transplanted NK cells in aged dentate gyrus compared to young.
Overall, normal brain ageing induces an environment that facilitates NK cell
accumulation.

Cellular senescence is known to trigger Nk cell surveillance and they found NK
cells close to SASP expressing neuroblasts. These cells reinforce NK cell
functions and surveillance resulting in the elimination of aged neuroblasts.
Restriction of NK cell activity could help facilitate neurogeneration and
ameliorate neurogenerative conditions as NK cell depletion mitigated the decline
in synaptic plasiticity and cognitive function.
