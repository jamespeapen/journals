While the risks for both neurodegeneration and cancer increase with age, there
is an inverse correlation between the odds of getting one or the other. A number
of genes, proteins, and pathways are shared, but in opposite directions. A
recent study found that the most shared risk SNPs were in the locus containing
the lncRNA ANRIL that modulates cell cycle regulators like *CDKN2A-B* that codes
for p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, a mediator of cellular senescence. Senescence may
contribute towards the inverse correlation between the risks for cancer and
neurodegeneration. Senescent cells could be a way to avoid cancer development,
but may contribute to neurodegeneration with age.

For the review of the evidence of senescence in these diseases, they used cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, the SASP, and SA-β-gal as senescence
markers.

They found some evidence to suggest that senescence protects against cancer, but
they did not find enough to come to a strong conclusion. One study found that in
pilocytic asrocytoma, a tumor formed from astrocytes, the presence of p16 and
SA-β-gal were associated with increased patient survival. Exposure to genetic
and external carcinogenic stimuli resulted in senescence markers being expressed
in brain cells.

However, most of the papers they read did not fully characterize
senescence, using only a few markers which meant that there may have been other
explanations for their results that don't include senescence. Some markers used,
like p21, are part of normal cell functioning and by themselves do not
necessarily indicate senescence.

Their conclusion was that additional work needed to be done in the area that
better identified senescence.
