Since neurodegenerative diseases are common in ageing brains, the authors
suggest that brain ageing might form a continuum with neurodegeneration. They
believe that ageing is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. AD and
PD tend to be observed in the elderly and the risk for disease increases with
age.

## Ageing biology

Hallmarks of ageing:

### Primary

- genomic instability
- telomere attrition
- epigenetic alterations
- loss of proteostasis

### Antagonistic or compensatory responses

- mitochondrial dysfunction
- cellular senescence
- deregulated nutrient sensing

There antagonistic responses are meant to combat the primary damage, but they
can eventually become damaging themselves.

### Integrative hallmarks

- stem cell exhaustion
- altered intercellular communication

There arise as a result of cumulative damage from the primary and antagonistic
hallmarks and are "ultimately responsible for the functional decline associated
with ageing".

Tissues with postmitotic cells are particularly sensitive to the effects of
ageing because they are more vulnerable to DNA damage.

### Cellular senescence

Cellular senescence is increased in AD, PD, ALS and Huntington disease.

The authors believe that the hallmarks related to mitochondrial dysfunction are
central and studies investigating communication between the nucleus and
mitochondria will contribute to the understanding of ageing.
