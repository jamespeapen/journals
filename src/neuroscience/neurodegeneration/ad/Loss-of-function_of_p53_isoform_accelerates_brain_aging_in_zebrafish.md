This study investigated the effects of an isoform of p53 on the zebrafish brain
ageing, learning and memory.

The zebrafish Δ133p53 isoform is an ortholog of the same human isoform and is
highly induced in response to low ROS levels and promotes cell survival and
inhibits senescence. It is found in the telencephalon ventricular zone.
Zebrafish with a mutant variant of this isoform have higher levels of ROS and
show accelerated ageing. Decreased expression of human Δ113p53 is associated
with replicative senescence and has been observed in the brains of patients with
AD and ALS. Examining a variant of this isoform and its role in brain ageing
they found that the expression of antioxidant genes significantly decreased in
mutant telencephalons compared to wild type. There were increased levels of
hydrogen peroxide as well as an increase in the level of SA-β-gal activity, an
indicator of cellular senescence.

They also ran a test to see how memory and learning would be affected by the
mutation. Using a swim tank, with one half colored red and the other colored
white, they shocked the fish when they were in the white area. The wild type
fish spent less time in the area coloured white compared to the mutant fish.
Although these differences were found between the two groups, they did not find
any significant differences between the DNA damage response or apoptotic
activity.

Interestingly, they also note that SIRT1, a senescence-related gene plays a
protective role in neurodegenerative disease and that it was downregulated in
the mutant group.  This downregulation along with the increased levels of ROS
could lead to increased brain ageing.

This paper showed how a mutation in the p53 isomer resulted in an increased risk
for developing senescence and also resulted in cognitive problems. This suggests
that there could be a link between an increased risk of senescence and
developing cognitive problems.
