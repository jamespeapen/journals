Both normal ageing and AD affect memory processes dependent on the hippocampus.
This paper identified 17 candidate ageing-associated genes and examined one
called RbAp48 whose expression decline was best correlated with ageing human
dentate gyrus.

RbAp48 is involved in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation and the
cAMP-PKA-CREB1 pathway. These are important for normal hippocampal function and
ageing.

## Results

### RbAp48 deficiency in the ageing human hippocampus

Using human brains free of pathology, they examined the expression of genes in
the dentate gyrus and found that RbAp48 had the largest expression change.

### A forebrain-specific, dominant-negative inhibitor of RbAp48 in mice

In WT mice, RbAp48 was expressed at high levels and was more abundant in young
mice than aged mice - selectively in the DG. Using a mouse with a
dominant-negative (RbAp48-DN) form of RbAp48 without the ability to interact with histone
H4, they inhibited RbAp48 function in the adult forebrain.

### Effect of forebrain-specific inhibition of RbAp48 on memory in young mice

They examined all their mice in open field tests and both the inhibited and
functional RbAp48 has similar results which meant that their anxiety levels were
not affected by the inhibition.

In a novel objection recognition test, both mice showed similar behaviour
initially, but after 48 hours however, the inhibited mice did not show a
preference for a novel object like the control mice did.When the expression of
the double-negative form of the protein was inhibited, both groups of mice
performed similarly in the novel object recognition test. The inhibition of
RbAp48 resulted in poorer novel object recognition performance.

In the Morris water maze, after one day of learning, the transgenic mice showed
impaired memory, but no noncognitive differences.

### Memory deficits in the transgenic and aged mice

Aged mice showed memory deficits similar to the young transgenic mice and had
similar performances as the young mice in learning tasks. The inhibition of
RbAp48 in the forebrain leads to the cognitive defects characteristic of
hippocampal ageing.

### Effects of the dominant-negative in the DG

Compared to control mice, the transgenic mice showed selective dysfunction in
the DG which was reversed when the dominant-negative gene was turned off.

### Effect of RbAp48-DN on histone acetylation in the DG

Examination of the acetylation of H4 and H2B showed that RbAp48 inhibition
caused a reduction in acetylation. This was also reversible when RbAp48-DN
expression was turned off.

### Effect of upregulating RbAp48 in aged mice

Increasing RbAp48 in the DG improved memory performance in the novel object
recognition test and the water test.

### Effect of RbAp48-DN expression in the forebrain on HAT activity of CBP

The CBP HAT activity was lower in the DG of the transgenic mice, but the amount
of CBP protein was the same. A selective reduction of CBP HAT activity in the DG
was found in aged WT mice.

## Discussion

RbAp48 deficiency occurs in rodent and human DG in association with normal
ageing. RbAp48 interaction with CREB1-dependent CBP and HAT regulation, which is
important for memory storage. There was a DG-specific reduction of HAT activity
in the transgenic young and aged mice. These effects were reversed in by
increasing RbAp48 abundance.

These results show that RbAp48 in the DG is necessary for hippocampal
functioning. They also suggest that age-related memory loss is independent of
AD and since other studies have not implicated RbAp48, these results show that
they have distinct mechanisms.

Since RbAp48 works through the PKA-CREB1-CBP pathway which is important to
age-related memory loss in mice, it could be a potential therapeutic avenue.
Enhancing he CREB1 pathway reduces age-related hippocampal dysfunction in
rodents and could have benefits for humans.
