The accumulation of Aβ has been the primary target of therapies, but attempt to
lower the plaque burden have not been successful in lowering cognitive decline.
The homeostatic regulation of iron could be a targetable pathway since there is
evidence it is disturbed in neurodegeneration.

Iron is involved in cellular respiration, DNA synthesis, cell division, oxygen
transport and neurotransmission. Iron can cycle through oxidation states, which
while biologically important, can lead to oxidative damage. There are
homeostatic mechanisms designed to regulate iron, but there is also an
age-related accumulation of iron in the brain. Iron dyshomeostasis may not get
high enough to result in iron toxicity, but its dyshomeostasis could result in
increased susceptibility to oxidative dysfunction.

## Iron dyshomeostasis and AD

Iron accumulation has been observed in brain regions affected by AD. The
intensity of accumulation depends on the subtype of AD and can be used to
distinguish between sporadic and familial AD. The forms of iron in AD patients
vary in the torque they experience in a magnetic field compared to controls.

Iron is associated with the pathological lesions in AD and it could be that it
promotes the aggregation and oligomerization of Aβ peptides. Iron and the iron
storage protein ferritin levels are associated with amyloid deposition amount.

Iron could enhance the translation and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid
precursor protein by its aberrant binding to APP mRNA. Iron is also involved in
tau phosphorylation and aggregation - events mitigated by iron chelation. NFT
tau accumulation is associated with the induction of heme oxygenase-1 which
releases iron from heme exacerbating oxidative stress.

Iron is associated with the rate of cognitive decline 12 years before death. CSF
ferritin levels can predict cognitive decline and the transition from MCI to AD.

## Cellular senescence, iron dyshomeostasis and AD

There is increasing evidence that senescence induction in the brain is linked to
neurodegeneration and that the removal of senescent cells in the brain leads to
improved cognition in mice models.

Senescent cells in vitro show iron dyshomeostasis and their abundance could
influence iron levels in ageing tissue. Iron promotes senescence in cultured
microglia. Chelators can reduce and prevent the accumulation of iron and
ferritin seen in senescence in vitro. Chelating iron in *C. elegans* led to
reduction in iron-dependent oxidation and cell death. The SASP may be a ferritin
expression driver in neurons and glia which makes them more susceptible to
ferroptosis - iron mediated cell death.

## Iron as a therapeutic target

Iron chelators have shown promise in PD and motor neuron disease. A study on
iron chelation found that using the chelator deferoxamine over two years slowed
the clinical progression of dementia associated with AD. Another study
inhibiting zinc and copper ions from binding to Aβ showed a positive effect and
reduction in cognitive decline rate for severely affected patients. There was
also a decline in Aβ42 in plasma.
