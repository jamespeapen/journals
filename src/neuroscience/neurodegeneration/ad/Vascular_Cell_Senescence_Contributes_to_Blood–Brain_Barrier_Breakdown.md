Age-related changes in the cerebrovasculature, including blood–brain barrier
(BBB) disruption, are emerging as potential risks for diverse neurological
conditions. Because the accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is
increasingly recognized as a critical step leading to age-related organ
dysfunction, we evaluated whether senescent vascular cells are associated with
compromised BBB integrity.

## Methods

Effects of vascular cell senescence on tight junction and barrier integrity were
studied using an in vitro BBB model, composed of endothelial cells, pericytes,
and astrocytes. In addition, tight junction coverage in microvessels and BBB
integrity in BubR1 hypomorphic (BubR1H/H) mice, which display senescence
cell-dependent phenotypes, were examined.

## Results

When an in vitro BBB model was constructed with senescent endothelial cells and
pericytes, tight junction structure and barrier integrity (evaluated by
transendothelial electric resistance and tracer efflux assay using sodium
fluorescein and Evans blue-albumin were significantly impaired. Endothelial
cells and pericytes from BubR1H/H mice had increased senescent-associated
β-galactosidase activity and p16INK4a expression, demonstrating an exacerbation
of senescence. The coverage by tight junction proteins in the cortical
microvessels were reduced in BubR1H/H mice, consistent with a compromised BBB
integrity from permeability assays. Importantly, the coverage of microvessels by
end-feet of aquaporin 4–immunoreactive astrocytes was not altered in the cortex
of the BubR1H/H mice.

## Conclusions

Our results indicate that accumulation of senescent vascular cells is associated
with compromised BBB integrity, providing insights into the mechanism of BBB
disruption related to biological aging.
