Age-related changes in the cerebrovasculature, including blood–brain barrier
(BBB) disruption, are emerging as potential risks for diverse neurological
conditions. Because the accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is
increasingly recognized as a critical step leading to age-related organ
dysfunction, we evaluated whether senescent vascular cells are associated with
compromised BBB integrity.

## Methods Effects of vascular cell senescence on tight junction and barrier
integrity were studied using an in vitro BBB model, composed of endothelial
cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. In addition, tight junction coverage in
microvessels and BBB integrity in BubR1 hypomorphic (BubR1H/H) mice, which
display senescence cell-dependent phenotypes, were examined.

## Results When an in vitro BBB model was constructed with senescent endothelial
cells and pericytes, tight junction structure and barrier integrity (evaluated
by transendothelial electric resistance and tracer efflux assay using sodium
fluorescein and Evans blue-albumin were significantly impaired. Endothelial
cells and pericytes from BubR1H/H mice had increased senescent-associated
β-galactosidase activity and p16INK4a expression, demonstrating an exacerbation
of senescence. The coverage by tight junction proteins in the cortical
microvessels were reduced in BubR1H/H mice, consistent with a compromised BBB
integrity from permeability assays. Importantly, the coverage of microvessels by
end-feet of aquaporin 4–immunoreactive astrocytes was not altered in the cortex
of the BubR1H/H mice.

## Conclusions Our results indicate that accumulation of senescent vascular
cells is associated with compromised BBB integrity, providing insights into the
mechanism of BBB disruption related to biological aging.
