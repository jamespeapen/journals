Neuropsychiatric symptoms like mood swings, hallucinations, and depression are
shared between AD and disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This
study analyzes genes expression changes in genes associated with bipolar
disorder (BIP), schizophrenia (SCZ), and major depressive disorder (MDD) using
an AD animal model.  They identified significantly altered genes in the gene
ontology pools associated with these psychiatric disorders to see whether these
symptoms in AD could be associated with them.

They found that the BIP, SCZ, and MDD related were significantly changed in the
AD animal model. The number of SCZ associated genes were higher than those of
BIP and MDD and SCZ was the most associated with AD and these genes are thought
to be involved in synaptic dysfunction in AD mice. They interpreted the genes
changes in the model as the probable cause of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in
the AD mice
