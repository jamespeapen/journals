Cellular senescence is necessary to prevent the spread of damaged cells and
could be a type of cell differentiation. There can be acute or chronic
senescence.

- Acute senescence is part of normal body functioning and processese like tissue
  repair.

- Chronic senescence is induced by extended exposure to stress and this produces
  cellular and tissue alterations.

  - Replicative senescence Stress induced premature senescence (SIPS)
  - Mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence

## General Senescence phenotypes

- Permanent cell cycle arrest because entrance to the S phase

- SASP: synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors

- Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction: high levels of oxidative
  stress induce senescence during aging and promote neuronal DNA damage,
  deregulated DNA damage response (DDR), changes to cell cycle progression and
  cell morphology, premature replicative senescence.

- Changes to cellular metabolism from altered mitochondrial function.

- Damage and alterations in DNA damage response

- Telomere shortening and dysfunction: there is reduced DNA repair and cell
  cycle arrest. While telomeric shortening is a major aging mechanism, telomere
  length does not always correlate with senescence

- Epigenetic modifications: changes in methylation enzyme activity that are
  associated with neuropathology

- Morphological changes: cytoskeletal rearrangement, more flat and irregular
  shape

- Altered proteostasis: increased unfolded protein response associated with
  endoplasmic reticulum stress.

- Promotion of chronic inflammation: neuroinflammation is both a trigger and a
  consequence of senescence and can spread the damage to neighbouring cells

- reduction in nervous system regenerative capacity because of the cell cycle
  arrest from senescence

- Loss of CNS cell function from the senescence and cell cycle arrests

## Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease

Increased senescence is found in AD brains through SA-β-gal expression, p53
expression, release of SASP components, DNA damage, telomeric damage and
senescence-like morphological changes.

Increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cellular senescence increase
Aβ burden, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death and accelerated cognitive
decline, all symptoms and pathology in Alzheimer's disease

The expression of senescence associated genes was shown to be upregulated on
exposure to Aβ.

### Senescence Phenotypes in AD

- Permanent cell cycle arrest: Aβ hypothesis: neurons are induced to divide
  which causes them to enter senescence

- SASP: microglial overactivation, enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines
  that aggravate Aβ and tau pathology

- Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction: increased ROS and altered
  mitochondrial structure and function - leads to cellular changes associated
  with senescence

- Telomeric DNA damage: non-telomeric DNA damage and repair: Increased DNA

- Damage and alterations in DNA damage response

- Epigenetic modifications: aberrant phosphorylation of histones, changes in
  methylation of AD critical genes - **what genes?**

- Morphological changes: increased size, flat and irregular shape, changes in
  membrane composition

- Altered proteostasis: loss of protein homeostasis, nuclear dysfunction,
  accumulation of abnormal proteins (amyloid peptides and hyperphosphorylated
  tau)
