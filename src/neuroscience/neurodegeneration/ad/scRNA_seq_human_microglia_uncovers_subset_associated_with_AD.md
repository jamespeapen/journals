This paper examined microglial heterogeneity in aging and AD brains using living
microglia. Through unsupervised clustering of 16,096 cell transcripts from the
Memory and Aging project they found 9 clusters of microglia, which was 5 more
than previously found by Mathys et al. Enrichment analyses showed that these
clusters were enriched for genes involved in neurodegenerative disease. They
also found that microglia cluster 7 at reduced frequency in AD cases. Cluster 7
gene was altered with respect to diagnoses of AD pathology and AD dementia. 2
and 5 were enriched in genes associated with beta amyloid. Clusters 4 and 7 had
higher expression of APOE and TREM2. The authors suggest that different types of
microglia may be involved in AD. Other individual clusters also showed
enrichment for other diseases like MS, neurovascular disease, and encephalitis.
