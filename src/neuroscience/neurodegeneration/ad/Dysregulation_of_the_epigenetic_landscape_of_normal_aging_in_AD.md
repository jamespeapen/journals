This paper examines the genome-wide enrichment of H4K16ac, an epigenetic
modification to the DNA packaging protein H4. H4K16ac has both transcriptional
activation and repression activities.

H4K16ac regulates chromatin compaction, gene expression, stress response and DNA
damage repair. Modulators of H4K16ac play a role in whole organism ageing and
cellular senescence. Senescent cells display a H4K16ac enrichment over promoter
regions of expressed genes. They considered that epigenetic regulation by
H4K16ac may be involved in human brain ageing and the progression of AD. They
compare the genome-wide profiles of H4K16ac in the brain tissue of AD patients
and age-matched and younger individuals without dementia. They found that normal
changes in brain H4K16ac is disturbed in AD.

## H4K16ac is redistributed during normal ageing and AD

Examining the H4K16ac changes they found no correlation between the neuronal
fractions and H4K16ac, but did find that AD patients had lower levels of H4K16ac
than age-matched controls.

The redistribution of H4K16ac peaks was different during normal ageing than AD
as in normal ageing H4K16ac was gained but in AD it was lost.

RNA-seq showed positive linear correlation between the enrichment at the closest
H4K16ac peak and gene expression in all subjects. There was also a mild
correlation between the magnitude of differential genes expression and
differential enrichment of the nearest H4K16ac peak for the significantly
differentially expressed genes.

## H4K16ac changes during normal ageing negatively correlated with changes in AD

Checking if the direction of the changes is correlated with the processes of
ageing and disease:

Pairwise comparisons showed a positive linear correlation between ageing and
ageing mixed with disease - demonstrates a component of normal ageing in AD.
There was also positive linear correlation between ageing mixed with disease and
disease alone. There was a clear negative correlation between the aging and
disease: decreased H4K16ac in AD compared to non-AD old patients correlated with
a higher H4K16ac in Old compared to Young.

## 3 classes of H4K16ac changes detected in AD

Age-regulated, age-dysregulated, disease-specific
