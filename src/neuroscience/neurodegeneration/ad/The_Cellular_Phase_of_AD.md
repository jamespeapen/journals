The linearity of the cascade remains very controversial. For instance,
exploration of the direct link between Aβ and neurotoxicity has resulted in a
rather confusing literature with at least ten different molecular mechanisms and
receptors (see Figure 1) (Benilova et al., 2012). It is debatable whether they
all equally contribute to the disease process in humans, as many of the
supporting studies used non-physiologically high concentrations of Aβ or
transgenic mice significantly overexpressing APP Thus, the neuron-centric view
has to be expanded to one that considers the contribution of different cell
types, their interactions with each other, and the gradual evolution of the
disease.

Instead of Aβ and Tau, the real causes of sporadic disease are upstream of these
proteopathies and are likely manifold, with aging being the major driver.

This paper examines the amyloid cascade hypothesis and questions the linearity
of the amyloid cascade in producing AD pathology, saying the biochemistry of the
brain needs to be intergrated. They found that studies supporting the amyloid
cascade hypothesis used non-physiologically high concentrations of Aβ or
transgenic mice overexpressing APP. Since a lot of 'confusing' literature with
many different molecular mechanisms have come out they are skeptical that all
equally contribute to AD pathology.  They also suggested that instead of Aβ and
tau, the real causes of sporadic disease may be upstream of those proteopathies,
with aging being the major driver of these conditions.

In general, they believe that the neuron-centric view needs to be expanded to
consider the contribution of different cell types and interactions including
astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and the role of the neurovascular unit
and the vascular hypothesis of AD. With single-cell sequencing, more of these
mechanisms and pathways can be explored.

They also suggested that instead of Aβ and tau, the real causes of sporadic
disease may be upstream of those proteopathies, with aging being the major
driver of these conditions.
