This study demonstrated the significance of inflammation in the development of AD neurodegeneration by comparing brains from AD patients, high pathology controls and normal controls. The high pathology controls (HPC) had Aβ deposition and NFT formation that qualified for an AD diagnosis.

Despite similar levels of Aβ deposition, the HPC patients showed no evidence of
synapse loss, but the AD patients did. The high pathology controls also had
significantly higher brain weights than those with AD.

Inflammation was measured as C5b-9 immunoreactivity and was found abundantly in
AD samples. The HPC inflamamtion levels on the other hand were more comparable
to those of normal controls. This immunoreactivity was the most sensitive
correlate of synapse loss. Lue et al. believed that it was one of the final
pathways through which Aβ and NFTs convey their neurodegenerative effects (Lue
et al. 1996) and move from just pathlogy to dementia.
