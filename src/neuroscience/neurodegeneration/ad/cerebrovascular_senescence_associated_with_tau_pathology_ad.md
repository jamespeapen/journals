Vascular dysfunction is implicated in AD pathogenesis as cerebrovascular
diseases are also found with AD. Reduced cerebral blood flow is associated with
cognitive decline and tau accumulation which is a pathological hallmark of AD.
Further, senescence and tau NFT formation show a positive feedback relationship.
This study tested whether endothelial senescence contributes to microvascular
alterations in tau-related neurodegeneration.

They found that senescence-associated genes were upregulated in microvessels and
these genes were also involved in the DNA damage response signalling pathway,
a pathway that could mediate senescence. They did not find any changes
in gene expression in the BBB or associations between the senescence-associated
protein levels in plasma and the severity AD-related changes.
